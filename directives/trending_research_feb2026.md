## 10 Content-Ready Trending Angles

Each angle maps to Ian's content pillars: Personal, Expertise, Social Proof, Trending, Opinions.

---

### 1. "AI Won't Replace You — A Coach Who Uses AI Will"
**Pillar:** Trending + Opinion
**The trend:** 75% of high-performing coaching businesses now use AI co-pilots. 68% of US small businesses use AI regularly (up from 48% in mid-2024). Yet the coaches winning aren't going full-auto — they're using AI as an amplifier.
**Ian's angle:** This is already his core thesis. Double down with fresh stats. Talk about how his ghostwriting process uses AI to generate 30 hooks, then *taste* picks the winner. The skill is curation, not generation. Position against the "just use ChatGPT" crowd.
**Hook ideas:**
- "I generate 30 hooks with AI. I use 1. Here's why the other 29 don't matter."
- "AI didn't replace my ghostwriting clients. It made the bad ghostwriters obvious."

### 2. LinkedIn's Algorithm Now Checks Your Receipts
**Pillar:** Expertise + Trending
**The trend:** LinkedIn's 2026 algorithm does a "360-degree profile check" before distributing content — if your bio says "coach" but you only engage with memes, you get buried. Views down 50%, engagement down 25%, follower growth down 59% across the platform. Quality over quantity is now enforced, not optional.
**Ian's angle:** Expertise post explaining why most coaches are invisible on LinkedIn and don't know why. Tie to his service: your content, profile, and engagement all need to tell the same story — that's what ghostwriting actually is.
**Hook ideas:**
- "LinkedIn just made personal branding mandatory. Here's what changed."
- "Your reach dropped 50% this year. It's not the algorithm — it's your profile."

### 3. The "AI Ghostwriter" Trap
**Pillar:** Opinion (Contrarian)
**The trend:** AI tools have collapsed the price of basic copywriting. Ghostwriting services are splitting into two tiers: commodity AI-generated content vs. premium "thinking business" ghostwriting that includes strategy, positioning, and voice.
**Ian's angle:** Strong contrarian take. Most people think ghostwriting = someone writes your posts. Real ghostwriting = someone thinks about your positioning, understands your audience, and builds a narrative. AI made the commodity tier worthless — which actually makes the premium tier more valuable. This is Ian's moat.
**Hook ideas:**
- "AI killed ghostwriting. (The $50/post kind.)"
- "Everyone's a ghostwriter now. Almost nobody is a good one."

### 4. The Hybrid-First Coaching Economy
**Pillar:** Expertise + Trending
**The trend:** The coaching industry is expected to surpass $6B in 2026. ICF says the industry has fully transitioned to "hybrid-first." Online + AI-augmented coaching isn't optional anymore — it's the baseline. AI-induced job displacement has fueled a 67% increase in new coaching ventures.
**Ian's angle:** More coaches than ever = more noise than ever = harder to stand out. This is the perfect setup for his "unique mechanism" and offer differentiation content. Position his services as the differentiator in a flooded market.
**Hook ideas:**
- "There are more coaches than ever in 2026. Here's why that's great news for the good ones."
- "The coaching industry just hit $6B. Most coaches are still broke. Here's the gap."

### 5. Social Search Is Replacing Google
**Pillar:** Expertise + Trending
**The trend:** Nearly 1 in 3 consumers skip Google entirely, starting searches on TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, or LinkedIn. LinkedIn itself is becoming a search engine for B2B buyers evaluating coaches and service providers.
**Ian's angle:** Your LinkedIn profile is now a landing page, not a resume. If someone searches "business coach [niche]" on LinkedIn and your content doesn't show up — or doesn't convert — you're invisible. Tie directly to his ghostwriting service: content is now discoverable, not just scrollable.
**Hook ideas:**
- "Your next client isn't Googling you. They're searching LinkedIn. Is your profile ready?"
- "LinkedIn is a search engine now. Most coaches' profiles are still resumes."

### 6. The Death of "Post Every Day" Advice
**Pillar:** Opinion (Contrarian)
**The trend:** LinkedIn's algorithm now rewards dwell time, saves, and comment quality over frequency. 2-3 high-value posts per week beat daily fluff. Engagement bait is actively downranked. Content saturation means posting less but more purposefully wins.
**Ian's angle:** Contrarian take against the hustle-culture content advice. Connect to his "rather have 2 great posts than 5 poor ones" philosophy. This validates his ghostwriting model — fewer, better posts that actually book calls > content hamster wheel.
**Hook ideas:**
- "I stopped posting every day. My leads went up."
- "The LinkedIn gurus told you to post daily. The algorithm just told them to stop."

### 7. Community > Audience in 2026
**Pillar:** Expertise + Trending
**The trend:** Community management is having a renaissance. Broadcast channels, smaller groups, and direct engagement are outperforming mass-reach tactics. Gen Z especially wants surprise-and-delight moments, not broadcast marketing.
**Ian's angle:** Tie to his outreach/sales system. The content attracts, but the DM conversation and community interaction convert. His 3-project system (content → outreach → sales) is exactly this model. Share how he builds relationships, not just followers.
**Hook ideas:**
- "I have fewer followers than most coaches in my niche. I have more clients."
- "Followers don't pay invoices. Conversations do."

### 8. The "Cognitive Debt" of AI Content
**Pillar:** Opinion + Personal
**The trend:** MIT research shows using ChatGPT to write essays creates "cognitive debt" — you learn less, think less, develop less. Over-reliance on AI produces generic, forgettable content. The human voices and real experiences are becoming the differentiator.
**Ian's angle:** Personal story about his own content process. He uses AI as a tool but the thinking — the strategy, the story selection, the voice — is human. This is what his clients are actually buying. Vulnerability angle: share a time he over-relied on AI and the content flopped vs. a personal story that crushed.
**Hook ideas:**
- "AI wrote my post last week. Nobody cared. Here's what I wrote instead."
- "The more AI writes your content, the less your audience trusts you. Here's the science."

### 9. Video Is Non-Negotiable Now
**Pillar:** Expertise + Trending
**The trend:** Native LinkedIn video gets +69% performance boost. Short-form video (under 90 seconds) is the most engaging format across all platforms. LinkedIn is actively pushing native video in the feed.
**Ian's angle:** If he's not already doing video, this is the nudge. If he is, share the results. Either way, expertise post about how coaches should be repurposing their best-performing written posts into 60-second videos. Or a personal post about getting comfortable on camera (ties to his "edge of comfort zone" theme).
**Hook ideas:**
- "Your best LinkedIn post should also be a 60-second video. Here's why."
- "I was terrified of video. Then I saw the numbers."

### 10. AI Displacement = Entrepreneurship Boom
**Pillar:** Trending + Personal
**The trend:** 67% increase in new ventures post-AI layoffs. Professionals are leaving corporate jobs and starting coaching, consulting, and service businesses. Startup costs are lower than ever with AI tools.
**Ian's angle:** Perfect for his ICP — new coaches and service providers entering the market who need help with positioning, content, and booking calls. Also a personal angle: his own journey from manual work to AI-augmented systems. Frame as opportunity, not threat.
**Hook ideas:**
- "AI didn't take my job. It gave me a better one."
- "The biggest wave of new entrepreneurs just started. Most will fail for one reason."

Creator Hooks

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

Title: Don't Retire Until You Hit These 5 Goals

Framework: Don't (Activity) Until You Hit These 5 Goals

): +313

Why this works:

Warning - Warnings like this do a great job of grabbing the
audience's attention.

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you want to know what
these goals are.

List - The list of 5 goals adds to the curiosity and makes this
video more tangible.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience to not do
something they want to do until they've hit some goals.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Don't Buy A House In Nashville Until You've Checked These 3

): +368

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience would love to know what will
actually work to help them learn French.

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you wonder what it is
that actually worked.

Refute Objection - Many people who've tried to learn French are
sick of apps and hacks, so this title refutes that objection
with, ""(No Apps, No Hacks).""

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience what will
actually work to help them achieve a goal without the things they
don't want.

Examples of this framework in action:

* What actually WORKED to Hit 100K Subs (No Bots, No Cringe)
* What actually WORKED to Read The Bible Every Day (No Apps, No

): +575

Why this works:

Desire - This lists out two benefits:

* 70g of Protein
* Tastes like a cheat mea

Curiosity - By not mentioning what the meal actually is, it opens
a loop and makes you want to click even more.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about
something that has a few benefits, but don't specify what it is.

): +619

Why this works:

Authority - Dropping in an authority figure in the beginning
lends credibility to your video.

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Negativity - This leverages negativity two different ways:

* It's a warning
* It's about people you should not help

How you can use this framework: Give your audience a warning
about things they should not do.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Warren Buffett's Warning: 7 Types of Stocks You Must Not Buy​

* Mayo Clinic Warning: 7 Sick Symptoms You Must Not Ignore

Why this works:

Curiosity - Counterintuitive statements like this do a great job
of building curiosity and getting people to click.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience that they need
to be or do something they don't necessarily want to do.

Examples of this framework in action:

Title: This Can Make or Break Your Retirement

Hook score: -87

Why this flopped: The wording in this title is a little weak.

It's a cliche, it doesn't take a side, and there's no strong
opinion. I think it might've done better if it were about either
making retirement or breaking retirement, but not ""make or
break."" Here are some examples of what I mean:

Making retirement:

""5 Things That Will Make Retirement EASY""

""99% Of People Don't Know The Secret To A Great Retirement""

Breaking retirement:

""5 Things That Will Ruin Your Retirement""

""99% Of People Are Accidentally Making This Retirement Mistake""

These two sets of titles take a bolder stance and avoid clichés.

Why this works:

Epic - There are two phrases that make this video feel epic:

* The word ""Every""
* ""Changed History Forever""

Negativity - People love dramatic topics like this.

Curiosity - The word ""change"" is powerful for building curiosity
because it makes you want to know what happened.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about every
major negative event that changed history forever.

Why this works:

Curiosity - This title builds curiosity in two ways:

* It's about the future, and since the future is unknown, it's a
naturally curiosity-filled topic.
* The word ""weird"" also sparks curiosity because it means this
video is about something different than normal, and people want
to know what's different about it.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience that something
in the future is looking very weird.

Examples of this framework in action:

* This Q4 Is Looking Very Weird For Ecommerce Businesses...
* This Next Wave of AI Tools is Looking VERY Weird…

Why this works:

Credibility - This title builds trust because it's not just an
opinion of some website builders, he's showing proof that he put
in a lot of effort to find the truth.

Desire - This creator's audience wants to know about the best
website builder.

How you can use this framework: Do one thing many times using
different tools to find the best one.

): +840

Why this works:

Negativity - Talking about what ""They"" promised to do, but aren't
doing, is a great way to give your title a feeling of drama and
conspiracy, which is intoxicating to many viewers.

Curiosity - ""But Here’s What They’re Doing Instead"" opens a loop
so you have to click to find out what they're doing.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about how
""they"" promised to do something good, but are doing something
else instead.

Examples of this framework in action:

* They Promised to Make Electrical Vehicles Environmentally
Friendly — But Here’s What They’re Doing Instead
* They Promised I Would Love Visiting Paris — But Here’s What
Really Happened

Title: Don’t Buy a SINGLE Thing at Marshalls Until You Watch

Framework: Don’t (Activity) a SINGLE (Entity) at (Place) Until
You Watch This!

): +1200

Why this works:

Negativity - Warnings with urgency like this do a great job of
grabbing the audience's attention and getting them to click.

The word ""SINGLE"" also does a few things: it makes this title
feel more focused, intense and confident.

How you can use this framework: Warn your audience to not do a
single thing somewhere until you watch this.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Don’t Post a SINGLE Instagram Reel Until You Watch This!
* Don’t Look at a SINGLE House in Orlando Until You Watch This!

Title: Are You Feeling Broke? How to Build Real Financial
Security

Hook score: -80

Why this flopped: Here's my hot take: You should never ask a
question in your title.

Yes, they can work occasionally, but for the most part, you're
better off making a bold statement.

Here are some ways we could rewrite this title:

""How to Build Real Financial Security (Even If You Feel Broke)""

""If You Feel Broke, Do THIS to Build Real Financial Security""

Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

Creator Hooks

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

P.S. If you want to save more time and use a title generator that
uses all the titles from this newsletter, check out ​Creator

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience would love to make money fast.

Speed - People love speed and ""as FAST as Possible"" promises that
here.

Extreme & Epic- ""as FAST as Possible"" sounds more exciting than
just ""Fast.""

How you can use this framework: Ask ChatGPT to do something (or
take on another challenge) as fast as possible.

Why this works:

Negativity - People are drawn to scary things like this.

Epic & Extreme - ""The Worst"" is way more exciting and interesting
than just ""Really Bad.""

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the
worst things in your niche, ranked.

Title: SECRET Weapon for a MOLD-FREE Home (It's Not What You

Framework: SECRET Weapon for a [Problem]-FREE [Entity] (It's Not

): +613

Why this works:

Curiosity - This makes you feel like you're getting in on a
secret in two ways:

* ""SECRET Weapon"" obviously makes you feel like you're getting in
on a secret.
* ""(It's Not What You Think)"" reinforces that feeling.

Negativity & Desire - This is all about a problem and solution:
having a mold-free home.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the
secret weapon to a problem-free thing.

Examples of this framework in action:

* SECRET Weapon for ACNE-FREE Skin (It's Not What You Think)​

* SECRET Weapon for a PEST-FREE Garden (It's Not What You Think)​

Why this works:

Curiosity - This builds curiosity in two ways:

* Comparing different things against each other does a great job
of building curiosity.
* The contrast of the different prices enhances the curiosity.

How you can use this framework: Compare different levels of
things in your niche.

Examples of this framework in action:

* $5,000 vs $50,000 vs $500,000 RVs

): +2247

Why this works:

Curiosity - ""No One Taught Us"" gives you a little bit of FOMO and
makes you feel like you're getting in on a secret.

Taboo - Taboo, sensitive, or personal things like feminine
hygiene do a great job of grabbing people's attention.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the
thing no one taught you about an attention-grabbing subject.

Examples of this framework in action:

* The Salary Negotiation Script No One Taught Us
* The Dating Red Flags No One Warns You About​

Title: Scrub Daddy all that? Let's find out!

Hook score: -70

Why this flopped: This title feels a little too clever and
clunky.

I think, ""all that,"" specifically, is too unclear, so here's how
we might reword it:

""These Sponges Are BETTER Than The Scrub Daddy""

This is more clear and states a bold opinion.

But let's say that the title I wrote above still doesn't work.
What then?

Well, it's possible ""Scrub Daddy"" isn't the best subject to focus
the title on. Here are some other options:

""Everything You Need To Know About Cleaning Sponges""

""I Tested The Top Cleaning Sponges - Here’s The Best One""

""This Changes Everything I Thought I Knew About Sponges""

Creator Hooks
*************

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

P.S. If you want to save more time and use a title generator that
uses all the titles from this newsletter, check out ​Creator

Title: They Got It ALL WRONG About Sleeping Bags

): +432

Why this works:

Negativity - Getting something ""ALL WRONG"" brings some
controversy and conspiracy here and makes for an interesting
video.

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you wonder what they got
wrong about sleeping bags.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience that ""they""
got it all wrong about something they're interested in.

Examples of this framework in action:

* They Got It ALL WRONG About Growing Potatoes In Your Backyard
* They Got It ALL WRONG About Learning Spanish

Why this works:

Tension - The tension of doing something hard, like taking a CIA
test, makes for an interesting and exciting video.

Contrast - The contrast between ""entry level"" and the extremely
elite CIA builds curiosity and interest.

How you can use this framework: Do the easy version of something
hard.

Examples of this framework in action:

* I tried the ""easiest"" Navy SEAL Hell Week Workout
* I took an ""entry level"" Google AI engineering test

Why this works:

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you want to know what
happened.

Constraint - The constraint of using ""ONLY ChatGPT"" makes this
more challenging and interesting.

How you can use this framework: Do something using only ChatGPT
(or another tool) and share what happened.

Examples of this framework in action:

* I Designed a Full Bible Study Plan Using ONLY ChatGPT, here's
what happened

Why this works:

Negativity - Controversy and conspiracy like this do a great job
of grabbing people's attention, riling them up and getting them
interested in your video.

Curiosity - The ""But Not Saying It"" part makes you feel like
there's a secret going on.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about how
someone is doing something controversial, but not saying it.

were doing something again, you'd do something else instead.

Title: Gore-Tex Sued for Lying to their Customers

Hook score: -92

Why this flopped: This is some spicy drama, which people normally
love. So what happened?

Well, ""They Cut Down The World’s Tallest Tree!"" (819K views) is a
similar title and did really well for this channel, but this one
is slightly different.

Gore-Tex getting sued feels like the corporate drama we tree
huggers are trying to avoid, while cutting down a massive tree
feels like an attack on something we deeply care about.

It's a slight, but significant difference that can have a big
impact on views.

Here are some questions to avoid a flop like this:

* Does this match why my audience watches my channel?
* Has this topic done well for my channel (or at least my
competitors) before?
* Is this topic something my target audience is interested in?

Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

Why this works:

Negativity - Controversy and drama, like ""greediest"" here, grabs
attention and makes for an interesting video.

Extreme - The fact that this video is about the greediest things,
and not just regular greedy things, makes this more extreme and
interesting.

How you can use this framework: Investigate the greediest (or
other similarly controversial) things in your niche.

Why this works:

Curiosity - This leverages curiosity in two ways:

* ""Change Forever"" opens a loop and makes you want to know what
changed and how.
* ""(and nobody even realises)"" makes you feel like you're getting
in on a secret.

Epic - ""Change Forever"" also makes this video feel epic.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about
something in your niche that's about to change forever, but they
don't even realize.

Why this works:

Negativity - People can't get enough of dramatic events like
this.

Specific - This is specific in two ways:

* It's about a single day.
* It goes through that day minute by minute.

Many people think being vague in your titles builds curiosity and
makes people want to watch your video, and it can, but talking
about specific details like this often does a great job of
building curiosity and interest, too.

Epic - Like in the social media video above, ""Changed Forever""
makes this video feel epic.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about a moment
that changed something forever.

Why this works:

Beginner - Making videos for beginners, in this case, talking
about ""the basics,"" is a great way to attract a large audience
that's eager to learn.

Desire - This creator's audience is into prompting tips.

Curiosity - Talking about things ""99% Of People STILL Don't Know""
gives you a little FOMO and makes you feel like you're getting in
on a secret.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about
something 99% of people still don't know the basics of.

): +1524

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience wants to be more productive.

Controversy - Adding ""It Feels ILLEGAL"" brings some spice and
controversy, and makes this video feel more interesting.

Refute Objection - Most people think you need to be motivated to
be productive, but this title gets rid of that assumption with
""(No Motivation Needed).""

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience how to be so
good at something it feels illegal. Then, at the end, drop in
that whatever they think they have to do to achieve that goal,
but don't want to do, your video makes it not necessary.

Examples of this framework in action:

* How to Hit A Golf Ball So Far It Feels ILLEGAL (No Super
Strength Needed)
* How to Learn Spanish So Fast It Feels Like Cheating (No
Memorization Needed)

Title: 20 SECRETS In Video Games

Hook score: -81

Why this flopped: This title seems pretty good — it's a list
about secrets. So what happened?

My theory is that it's not specific enough.

What are the secrets about? What are the consequences of these
secrets? For what game? Who should watch this video?

Here are some ways we could answer these questions for more
tangible, interesting titles:

""20 Secret Cheat Codes In Video Games""

""20 Secret Easter Eggs In Video Games""

""20 Mario Kart Secrets You've Never Seen""

""20 Secrets Every Adult Gamer Needs To See""

""20 Secrets That Prove Game Developers Are Amazing Humans""

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

P.S. If you want to save more time and use a title generator that
uses all the titles from this newsletter, check out ​Creator

Title: Cars Dealers Can’t Sell (August 2025) | It’s Getting Worse
RIGHT NOW

Framework: [Entities] [Authority Figures] Can’t [Action]

​Hook score (
https://click.convertkit-mail.com/wvug8n9g59hghkwgne0i7hn6z5zxxi8h6l226/e0hph7h7k0er27i8/aHR0cHM6Ly9jcmVhdG9yaG9va3MuY29tL2hvb2stc2NvcmUtZXhwbGFpbmVkLw==
): +367

Why this works:

Timeliness - This works so well because it's news about what's
going on right now. I love when channels have a repeatable format
like this they can use every month and bank on it getting lots of
views.

Negativity - Drama like this does a great job of grabbing
people's attention and interest.

Curiosity - This also opens a loop and makes you wonder what cars
are on this list.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about things
that authority figures or providers can't do right now.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Destinations Airlines Can't Book (August 2025) | It's Getting
Worse RIGHT NOW
* Popular Stocks I Would Never Buy (August 2025) | The Hype Is
Bad

): +506

Why this works:

Negativity - This starts with a warning to grab your attention.

Curiosity - This is counterintuitive because you'd think clothes
that are too tight can't be saved.

Desire - This audience would love to save clothes that don't fit
anymore.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience to stop doing
something they're likely doing and how to save something that's
normally unsalvageable.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Don't Throw Them Away! Here's How to Save Plants That Look Dead
* Don't Throw It Away! Here's How to Save Food That's Going Bad

): +1098

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about), and they add some curiosity.

Curiosity - There's contrast between ""1960s Songs"" and ""Still
Resonate Today"".

Nostalgia - Nostalgia works great for many niches.

Negativity - ""Protest Songs"" brings some controversy and spice to
this video.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about
controversial things that used to be relevant a while ago, but
are still relevant today.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Top 10 1920s Fashion Trends That Still Look Great Today

): +1296

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about), and they add some curiosity.

Specific Audience - By calling out a specific audience (""People
Starting Over""), this makes this video feel like it was made for
them, so they're more likely to click.

Desire - People starting over are likely eager to learn about the
best jobs for themselves.

Negativity - People starting over are often struggling, and
making videos for people who are struggling is an excellent
strategy because they're often open to learning and change.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the best
things for people who are struggling.

): +8695

Why this works:

Negativity - Drama and controversy like this do a great job of
grabbing attention.

Timeliness - This drops in the current year to let you know this
is relevant right now.

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you wonder what's going
to happen to our world.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience that now is
the end of something.

Title: Why Automakers Can’t Move Factories Overnight

Hook score: -73

Why this flopped: If you want to build curiosity in your titles,
you need to spark a question in your audience's mind that they
want answers to.

This title might spark a question, but you don't need to watch
the video because the answer is obvious. Of course Automarkers
can't move factories overnight! That sounds way too difficult.

This video is about tariffs, and it might've done better if it
focused on the problems buyers and manufacturers are facing,
rather than asking an obvious question.

Maybe something like, ""The REAL Problem With Manufacturing Cars
In The U.S."" or ""Tariffs Will Change The Way We Buy Cars
Forever"".

): +418

Why this works:

Curiosity - This leverages curiosity in two ways:

* It kinda makes you feel like you're getting in on a secret
about cool Dallas suburbs.
* It opens a loop and makes you want to know what these Texas
suburbs are about.

FOMO - ""No One Talks About"" not only builds curiosity, but also
gives you a bit of FOMO about these suburbs.

Desire - This creator's audience is into cool Dallas suburbs.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about things
no one talks about, but should.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Cryptocurrencies No One Talks About...But Should!
* National Parks No One Talks About...But Should!

): +419

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about), and they add some curiosity.

Curiosity - It's counterintuitive that common weeds would
actually be expensive superfoods.

Desire - This creator's audience would love to find expensive
superfoods in their yard.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about
supposedly unfortunate things they're probably dealing with that
are actually incredible things.

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about), and they add some curiosity.

Curiosity - ""Subtle Signs"" and ""Most Parents Miss"" build
curiosity because it feels like you're getting in on some secret
insider knowledge.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about subtle
signs of something important that most people in your niche miss.

it doesn't specify what will change or how it will change.

change is something awesome.

Title: Why Your Body FEELS 10 Years Older Than It Is (And how to
fix it)

Hook score: -98

Why this flopped: I’m not sure of one particular reason this
flopped, but here are some ideas:

* Most of the successful videos are about certain exercises, so a
title like, “Do These Exercises Every Morning To Stop Feeling
Stiff,” might’ve been a better approach.
* It might’ve been more effective and clear to say “Why You’re 40
But FEEL 50 (And how to fix it)”. That states the “feel 10 years
older” in more easier-to-read terms. Of course, it also narrows
the audience, so that would depend on the channel’s audience
whether or not it makes sense to narrow the focus.
* It also might’ve been more effective if the title were more
focused on a specific pain, like “Why Your Back Hurts Every
Morning (And how to fix it)”.

In summary, know why people watch your channel and deliver on
that, and use simple, visual language in your titles.

Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

Why this works:

Curiosity - This builds curiosity in two ways:

* It's counterintuitive because most of us would assume Earth's
rotation speed would never change.
* It opens a loop because it doesn't specify how it's changing or
what the effects of it are.

Also, ""Change"" is just one of those topics that humans are wired
to pay attention to. Back in the caveman days, changes in our
environment could have meant life or death, so we needed to
notice them.

How you can use this framework: Explain why something that
seemingly shouldn't change is changing.

): +920

Why this works:

Time Frame - The time frame of 5 minutes makes this more tangible
and desirable.

Constraint - The constraints of this makeup only requiring 5
products, not requiring any foundation, and only taking 5
minutes, make it more interesting and appealing.

List - The list of 5 products adds curiosity because you want to
know what they are.

Refute Objection - If you don't like foundation, this title gets
rid of that objection by promising you don't need it.

Desire - This creator's audience is into makeup, and ""Quick &
Easy"" adds to the desire.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about
something they're into that's short, only requires a few things,
and doesn't require something they'd expect it to require, but
don't want it to.

): +2152

Why this works:

Constraint - The fact that this is about just one trick makes you
more interested in the trick and increases the value of it. It
also makes for an easier decision to watch this video — you just
need to learn about one trick to help your parking, not a list of
20.

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you wonder what the trick
is.

Desire - This creator's audience is into parking tricks.

Absolute - Words like ""Every"", ""Any"", ""Always"", and ""Never"" often
work great on YouTube because people are drawn to strong, bold
opinions.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about one
trick that works every time.

* This One Guitar Trick Sounds Great EVERY Time.

Curiosity - Making videos about secrets is a simple, but
effective way to build curiosity.

Specific Audience - When you call out a specific audience, like
""After 50"", it makes them feel like your video was made
specifically for them, and they're more likely to click.

Refute Objection - Many people don't want to do hard cardio to
lose weight, but this title gets rid of that objection by
promising ""No Hard Cardio.""

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about a simple
activity secret that can help a specific group achieve a goal.
Then at the end, promise they don't have to do something they
hate doing, but in many cases, have to do to achieve that goal.

Examples of this framework in action:

* This Listening Secret Prevents Divorces For Frustrated Couples
(No Therapy Sessions)
* This Sleep Secret Reduces Wrinkles After 45 (No Botox)

Why this works:

Negativity - Warnings like this do a great job of grabbing the
audience's attention.

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you wonder what ""This""
is.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience to never do
something in a high-stakes situation, but build curiosity by not
specifying what it is they're not supposed to do.

Examples of this framework in action:

* NEVER Do This When Listing Your Home For Sale (or You’re DONE)
* NEVER Do This When Visiting Europe (or You’re DONE)

Title: Stop Guessing! Use This Cabin Trick to Avoid Scratches

Hook score: -74

Why this flopped: The very first thing that came to my mind when
I read this was, “What am I guessing at?”

II didn’t have any context when I first read ""Stop Guessing!"" and
the exclamation mark told me that the first sentence was over, so
for a split second, I was confused. Definitely not the first
emotion you want someone to experience when they read your title.

Unfortunately, as I kept reading, I got even more confused. I
haven't really heard the term ""Cabin"" much in reference to cars.
I know what it means, but it's just not a term I hear that often,
so it took me a second to understand what I was reading.

I’m not necessarily a car guy, so maybe I’m not the right
audience, but ideally, your title is easily understood by
everybody.

So there are two things I’d fix here:

* I’d remove the “Stop Guessing!” part of the title and just get
straight to the meat of it.
* I’d swap out “cabin trick” for a word or term more people are
familiar with, like “hood trick” or “windshield trick.”

Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about), and they add some curiosity.

Specific audience - Calling out a specific audience, especially
one that may be lacking the thing your video is about, is a great
way to grab the right attention.

Desire - This audience would love to be irresistible.

Authority - This leverages a bit of authority by dropping in a
popular psychologist's name at the end.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about habits
that give a specific audience a desired result.

Examples of this framework in action:

* 6 habits that give introverts MAGNETIC charisma
* 6 habits that turn beginners into GREAT guitarists

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about), and they add some curiosity.

Beginners - Calling out beginners works so well because they're
the biggest and most eager to learn group of any audience.

Negativity - Nobody wants to make a mistake, so mistakes make for
great video topics.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the top
beginner mistakes in your niche.

): +1376

Why this works:

Desire - Most people would love to be dangerously confident

Time Frame - The time frame of 15 minutes does 2 things here:

* It makes this video more tangible and interesting.
* It increases the desire because 15 minutes isn't that long to
become dangerously confident.

Drama - ""Dangerously Confident"" sounds a lot cooler and adds more
drama and spice than just ""Confident"".

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience to give you a
specific amount of time and you'll help them achieve a cool,
spicy goal.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Give me 15 Minutes and I'll Make you Dangerously Handsome

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience would love to run faster.

Another element at work here is, ""show don't tell."" If this title
were ""how to run really fast,"" that probably wouldn't have been
as effective as running ""so fast it feels unnatural.""

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience how to do
something so well it feels unnatural.

Examples of this framework in action:

* How to learn so fast it feels unnatural
* How to get promoted so fast it feels like cheating

fun and dramatic way to say ""get an A on your exam.""

When you're writing titles, it often helps to talk about things
in broad terms. This makes it easier to read and understand.

In this example, most people don't know who Markelle Fultz is,
but even if they did, they may not be interested, or it may take
them a second to scan through their memory to remember who he is.

""NBA Bust"" is way more interesting, easier to read, and easier to
understand.

If you find yourself getting into the weeds in your titles, back
it up a bit and give things broadly appealing labels so that your
audience can quickly and easily know what your video is about.

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

P.S. If you want to save more time and use a title generator that
uses all the titles from this newsletter, check out ​Creator

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about), and they add some curiosity.

Curiosity - This builds curiosity in two ways:

* ""Changes"" is a great, curiosity-filled topic, and it makes you
wonder what the changes are.
* The future is another naturally curiosity-filled and
interesting topic.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about major
changes coming in the future.

Why this works:

Authority - Restaurants are an authority when it comes to good

themselves.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience why something
is always better when it's done by an authority figure than by

Why this works:

Negativity - Warnings like this do a great job of grabbing
attention.

Curiosity - This builds curiosity in two ways:

* It's counterintuitive. Isn't donating your clothes a good
thing?
* ""do this instead"" opens a loop and makes you wonder what the
alternative is.

How you can use this framework: Warn your audience not to do
something that's common and supposedly good.

Desire - This leverages desire 3 ways:

Title: Make This for Your Next Wine Night to Impress Everyone |
America's Test Kitchen

Hook score: -70

Why this flopped: I love that this title is about status —
impressing everyone. But why did it do so poorly compared to
other videos on the channel? Two reasons:

1) When you first glanced at the thumbnail, did you immediately
know what it was?

Maybe I'm just a simple man with simple tastes, but it took me a
second to realize what I was looking at.

It might've done better if it were a slightly clearer image of
clams (they are clams, right?).

Here's a quote to remember when making your titles and
thumbnails: ""If you confuse, you lose.""

2) I also love that this title is about a specific moment: making
food for wine night.

But how many people in this audience are making food for wine
night? It's possible it's not that popular of a moment, or the
audience isn't struggling to make food for that moment.

If they wanted to get away from the wine night angle, they could
try a title that just hypes up the clams, like, ""These 10-Minute
Steamed Clams Will Change Your Life"".

): +420

Why this works:

Specific Audience - Calling out a specific audience, like ""Over
50?"" in this case, is a great way to grab the right audience's
attention.

Negativity - This is about items NOT to wear, which leverages
people's fear of making a mistake and looking bad.

Timeliness - This uses timeliness to let the audience know this
is relevant right now in two ways:

* The current season
* The current year

How you can use this framework: Call out a specific audience and
tell them to ditch things that are relevant right now.

): +724

Why this works:

Negativity - This is all about a well-known problem, which grabs
attention.

Desire - This offers a little bit of hope. If Japan escaped this
problem, maybe there's a solution.

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you wonder how Japan
escaped this problem (and what's wrong with Americans that made
them get fat).

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience how one group
escaped a problem, while another group suffered from it.

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Curiosity - ""Hidden"" and ""Keeping Quiet About On Purpose"" both
make you feel like you're getting in on a secret.

Authority - The fact that ""Airlines"" are the ones keeping these
tricks quiet makes them feel more credible.

Desire - This creator's audience is into flight tricks. And I
feel like ""On Purpose"" makes these tricks seem even more
valuable.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about tricks
authority figures are keeping quiet about on purpose.

): +2388

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience would love to make drawing
easier.

""5x"" makes this video feel more tangible and interesting than
just ""How To Make Drawing Easier"".

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience how to make
something a specific amount easier.

Examples of this framework in action:

* How To Make Street Photography 7x Easier
* How To Make YouTube Videos 5x Faster

**************
Sweet Stadiums

): +5741

Why this works:

Interest - This creator's audience is interested in how the MLB
ballparks compare.

Credibility - Since he's gone to all 30, his opinion is more
trustworthy.

Complete - Words like ""all"", ""every"", and ""any"" make videos feel
more complete and interesting.

How you can use this framework: Try every option of something and
report on how they compare.

Examples of this framework in action:

* I Went To All 12 Countries in South America (Here Are My
Rankings)
* I Went To All 46 Types of Christian Churches (Here Are My
Thoughts)

Title: 11 Airport Secrets They DON'T Want Us to Know in 2025!

Hook score: -98

Why this flopped: This video was published in May of 2025, so ""in
2025"" just isn't that powerful anymore because it's closer to the
middle of the year.

If this were published in December, January, February, or March,
it might've done better.

Plus, the thumbnail is too vague.

The curiosity sweet spot is right in the middle of ""I have no
idea what this is"" and ""I know exactly what this is.""

The thumbnail points to something that's way too far on the ""I
have no idea what this is"" side, so it doesn't build enough
curiosity.

If you want to avoid a flop like this, use a better angle than
""in 2025"" if it's in the middle of the year, and make the
imagery in your thumbnails more specific.

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

P.S. If you want to save more time and use a title generator that
uses all the titles from this newsletter, check out ​Creator

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Curiosity - It's counterintuitive that ""healthy"" habits would
keep her fat.

Negativity - This is about a pain point: staying fat.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about good
habits that kept you in a bad state.

Why this works:

Negativity - This uses fear to grab your attention.

Time Frame - The time frame of ""in 3 Seconds"" makes this feel
more tangible and increases the desire to watch this video since
it's so short.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience how to stop

Title: How to Grade Your Dog's Behavior: From F to A

Hook score: -87

Why this flopped: People love benchmarks and seeing how they
compare, so why did this flop?

My guess is that people don't want to grade their dog's behavior,
they want to skip that step and just have a better-behaved dog.

The thumbnail hints at that, but the title doesn't.

It might've done better if it were, ""How to Turn Your Dog's
Behavior From F to A"".

Or, to be even more direct, we could try, ""How to Turn Your Crazy
Dog Into a Calm, Obedient Dog"".

The lesson: write your title about the end goal the audience will
get, not about the difficult journey they have to go on.

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

P.S. If you want to save more time and use a title generator that
uses all the titles from this newsletter, check out ​Creator

Title: Listening is *the only* skill you need to become fluent
(here's why)

Framework: [Activity] is *the only* skill you need to [Achieve
goal] (here's why)

): +327

Why this works:

Curiosity - The constraint that listening is the only skill you
need to become fluent builds curiosity because it’s
counterintuitive. Shouldn’t speaking and other skills be
necessary, too?

Desire - This creator’s audience would love to become fluent.
Plus, the fact that listening is the only skill you need to
become fluent increases the audience's desire to learn about it.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the only
skill they need to achieve a goal.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Sleep is *the only* habit you need to master to get healthy
(here’s why)
* This is *the only* skill you need to blow up on Instagram

): +589

Why this works:

Desire - This leverages desire two ways:

* This creator's audience loves renovations.
* Since the house was only $1, some people feel like they could
do this, too.

Curiosity - $1 house builds so much curiosity because it makes
you ask all sorts of questions, like:

* How in the world did she get a $1 house?
* How bad of shape is a $1 house?
* What does it look like now?

A $1 house is kind of an oxymoron because it just doesn't seem
possible.

How you can use this framework: Do an activity your audience
wants to do and start with the absolute bare minimum.

Examples of this framework in action:

* I Turned $1K Into A $1,000,000 Business (Start to Finish)
* I Saved A Dying Marriage (Exactly How I Did It)

): +635

Why this works:

Authority - #1 Golf coach brings attention, trust and credibility
to this video.

Negativity - This is all about a pain point: hitting your driver
all wrong.

Credibility - This might be a little weak, but ""PROVES"" sounds
more credible and believable than just ""explains why"" or
something.

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you want to know how this
coach proves you're hitting your driver all wrong.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about how an
authority figure proves they're doing something wrong.

Examples of this framework in action:

* This #1 Sales Trainer PROVES You're CLOSING deals all wrong!!

): +895

Why this works:

Authority - ""Ex-CIA Officer"" brings authority and trust to this
video.

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Negativity - This leverages the fear of your phone getting hacked
to grab your attention.

How you can use this framework: Have an authority figure reveal
signs that something bad has happened.

): +1440

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Desire - This creator's audience wants to improve their sound
design.

Curiosity - ""Secrets"" is a great, simple way to build curiosity.

Negativity - ""CHEATING"" brings some controversy here that grabs
the audience's attention.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about secrets
that feel like cheating.

Title: Is a Backup Gun Necessary for Self-Defense?

Hook score: -93

Why this flopped: Here's a strategy that I've heard a lot of
people recommend: Take questions your audience has asked and just
make videos answering them.

Sometimes that's a good strategy, but sometimes it leads to very
specific videos that don't resonate with a large part of your
audience.

That's what this video feels like to me.

But even with this very specific idea, I think the title could
still be better.

Titles that are bold opinions often do better on YouTube than
questions like this.

This video might have done better if the title were more
opinionated, like: ""Here's Why You Don't Need A Backup Gun For
Self-Defense""

Or it could've taken more of a personal opinion and story angle:
""Here's Why I Never Carry A Backup Gun Anymore""

Or, if the topic of backup guns just isn't cutting it for the
audience, we could make it more broad.

Something like, ""This Popular Self-Defense Hack Is A Waste Of
Time & Money"".

Negativity - People love drama like this.

banning it so soon.

Negativity - This is about avoiding a problem (hurting your lure
action).

Credibility - By promising a side-by-side underwater look, this
video feels more credible and believable.

How you can use this framework: Ask if something really causes a
problem, and then promise some element of proof.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Do Credit Checks REALLY Lower Your Credit Score? (FICO Score
Tracking)
* Does Leaving Your Phone Charging REALLY Damage the Battery? (30
Day Test)

***********
Oh, really?

Title: Every Font is Free

Framework: Every (Entity) is Free

): +3755

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience would love for every front to be
free.

Curiosity - This is counterintuitive because many fonts are not
free.

This combo of desire + curiosity makes this video feel too good
to be true, but there's a sliver of hope, so you've gotta watch
it if you're a font guy or gal.

How you can use this framework: Make a bold, counterintuitive
statement that feels too good to be true.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Every Marketing Tool is Free
* Every Plane Ticket is Free

Title: The 1 Bass Spawning Behavior I DIDN'T Expect (Dock Cam
Footage)

Hook score: -71

Why this flopped: This creator's audience has one goal: catch
more bass.

My guess is that although bass spawning behavior can be related
to catching bass, it's a few steps away.

It takes a bit of mental work for the audience to realize that
this video can help them with their main goal.

And since most people are mindlessly scrolling on YouTube, any
amount of mental work is often too much work, so they scroll on
by and choose another video.

A super simple change might be just: ""The 1 Bass Behavior I
DIDN'T Expect (Dock Cam Footage)"" (just remove the word
""spawning."")

You could also try a more dramatic title with a broader angle:
""Underwater Video Changes Everything I Thought I Knew About Bass""

TLDR: Know why people watch your videos and have your titles
reflect that, and make your titles super simple to read and
understand.

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

P.S. If you want to save more time and use a title generator that
uses all the titles from this newsletter, check out ​Creator

Title: “This Is What I Think Of Pete Hegseth” - Jocko Willink

Framework: “This Is What I Think Of (Trending or polarizing
subject)” - (Authority Figure)

): +669

Why this works:

Authority - People are interested in what authority figures like
Jocko Willink have to say.

Timeliness - People love polarizing and/or trending topics, like
Pete Hegseth in this case.

Curiosity - This does a great job of opening a loop and making
you wonder what he thinks, so you have to click and find out.

How you can use this framework: This one is simple — just share
what an authority figure in your space thinks about a trending or
polarizing topic.

Examples of this framework in action:

* “This Is What I Think The Future of AI Is” - Sam Altman
* “This Is What I Think Of SGA” - Michael Jordan

Why this works:

Negativity - Warning someone to not do something does a great job
at grabbing their attention.

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you want to know what
“THIS” is.

Urgency - This makes you feel like you need to watch this now.

How you can use this framework: Warn your audience to not do
something they want to do until they’ve done “this”.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Don't start meditating before you've done THIS
* Don't start stretching your hips before you've done THIS

): +4094

Why this works:

Curiosity - This builds curiosity two ways:

* It opens a loop and makes you wonder what the choice is.
* Since it's about just one choice, this constraint raises the
stakes of that one choice and makes it more interesting.

Time Frame - The time frame of ""Your Next 5 Years"" also raises
the stakes of this one choice.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about one
thing that will make a big difference for their future.

Examples of this framework in action:

* The One Choice That Will Determine Your Whole Career
* The One Choice That Will Determine America's Next 10 Years

): +4451

Why this works:

Curiosity - Using the word ""Secret"" is a simple way to build
curiosity and make the audience feel like they're getting in on a
secret.

Desire - This audience would love for their plants to grow
faster.

Negativity - They would also love to repel pests.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about a secret
thing that helps them achieve a goal and avoid a problem.

): +17518

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience wants to study more. The
confident tone of this title makes you feel like this video can
help you.

Curiosity - Many people struggle with studying, so saying it's
""Easy, Actually,"" is counterintuitive.

Controversy - Saying getting ""ADDICTED"" to studying is more bold,
polarizing, and controversial than just, ""studying more,"" so it
grabs more attention.

Contrast - The contrast between ""ADDICTED"" (negative connotation)
and ""STUDYING"" (positive connotation) makes this title more
interesting.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience that getting
addicted to something beneficial, but is sometimes hard to do, is
easy, actually.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Getting ADDICTED to Practicing Piano is Easy, Actually
* Getting ADDICTED to Eating Healthy is Easy, Actually

Title: The Battle Between Elon, Trump & The Left - Naval Ravikant

Hook score: -82

Why this flopped: People love drama, so the idea of this sounds
great, but I think part of the reason it flopped because it's too
complicated.

Specifically, I think there are too many nouns.

Elon, Trump, The Left, Naval Ravikant — these four nouns make
this title hard to digest.

One thing they could do is take a stand and write the title about
just one of the sides: ""Why Trump Is Dominating The Left - Naval
Ravikant""

(I'm not saying that's true or what this video is about — just
using this as an example.)

You could also argue that since this video has so few views
compared to the rest of the channel, people aren't interested in
this battle.

Part of this video is about power, and since this channel is
about improving yourself, that could be an interesting focus for
the title.

The title could be something like, ""Why Leaders Today Have More
Power Than Any Other Man In History.""

TLDR: Take a bold stance, or change the subject of the title if
your video is struggling.

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

P.S. If you want to save more time and use a title generator that
uses all the titles from this newsletter, check out ​Creator

Title: We Chased Driverless Trucks In Texas. What We Saw Will
Scare You.

Framework: We (Investigated new technology). What We Saw Will
Scare You.

): +424

Why this works:

Credibility - This isn't just an armchair opinion — they actually
went and gathered firsthand information, which makes this video
feel more credible.

Negativity - Scary things do a great job of grabbing people's
attention and interest.

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you wonder what they saw.

How you can use this framework: Go get firsthand information
about a new technology and build curiosity by only telling the
audience which emotion they'll feel about it.

Examples of this framework in action:

* We Tested AI Video Generators. What We Discovered Will Scare
You.
* We Tried Viral TikTok Beauty Products. What We Found Is
Horrifying.

): +1859

Why this works:

Curiosity - This builds curiosity by asking a big, bold question.

The thumbnail complements this perfectly by showing that
something big happened in 1971.

How you can use this framework: Ask what happened at a specific
point or time, and show a big change in a graph.

* WTF Happened In My Latest Video?
* WTF Happened To New York City?

Title: You Don’t Want Love—You Want to Be Picked So You Feel
Worthy

Framework: You Don’t Want (Desirable entity)—You Want (True
desire)

​Hook score (

): +1945

Why this works:

Curiosity - ""You Don't Want Love"" is counterintuitive to people
who assume they want love.

Negativity - Telling people what they don't want does a great job
of grabbing attention.

Desire - This resonates with the audience and reveals to them
what they truly desire.

Note: This format is only effective if you know your audience's
hopes, desires, and fears. The best creators know their audiences
better than their audience knows themselves.

How you can use this framework: Make a counterintuitive statement
telling the audience they don't want what they think they want,
and tell them what they actually want instead.

Examples of this framework in action:

* You Don't Want To Be Rich—You Want To Be Wealthy
* You Don't Want A Clean House—You Want to Feel In Control

): +2444

Why this works:

Curiosity - This builds curiosity three ways:

* It's counterintuitive because you think he'd have a better
chance at building a $23M business in the U.S. than in India.
* It's counterintuitive that a burrito business can be so big.
* And maybe I'm just an ignorant Florida man, but I don't
associate burritos with India, so that's also counterintuitive.

Desire - This creator's audience would love to build a $23M
business (bonus points if it involves burritos).

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience how you, or
someone else, left an advantageous position for a less
advantageous position, but achieved something amazing.

Examples of this framework in action:

* I Ditched My $5,000 Canon For A Polaroid And Took Better Photos

): +3562

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Curiosity - The contrast between ""recognizable songs"" and ""you
don't know the name of"" builds curiosity.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about a list
of things they'd recognize, but don't truly know.

* 20 Recognizable actors you don't know the name of

)
Title: What It Really Takes To Transform Vehicles Into Homes

Hook score: -99

Why this flopped: One of the golden rules of marketing is to talk
about benefits, not features.

This title feels like it's doing the opposite — talking about
features, not benefits.

Talking about ""what it really takes"" isn't as exciting as what
you actually get: a sweet home made out of a vehicle.

If it were me, that's what I'd focus my title on. Something like,
""Turning A Van Into Your Home Will Change Your Life Forever"".
This is focused more on what you get (change your life forever)
than what it takes.

Here's the lesson: think about the outcome your audience will get
from your video, and make the title about that.

Why this works:

Negativity - This is full of polarizing drama and controversy,
which does a great job at grabbing people's attention.

Even though this isn't a style I'd personally use, this does show
how drama and bold statements can do well on YouTube.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience that something
is dead and they should have made a better decision.

about where you rank compared to others.

How you can use this framework: Have an authority figure explain
the levels of something in your niche.

Examples of this framework in action:

* PERSONAL TRAINER EXPLAINS: The 6 Levels Of Fitness
* TAMPA REALTOR EXPLAINS: The 6 Levels of Neighborhoods In
Hillsborough County

Title: How To RAISE A CONFIDENT CHILD! Without Forcing THEM Out
Of Their SHELL

Framework: How To (Achieve goal)! Without (Unwanted action)

​Hook score (

): +11492

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience would love to raise a confident
child.

Refute Objection - Many people might think they have to force
their child out of their shell in order to get them to become
confident, but this title refutes that objection.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience how to do
something without something they assume they have to do, but
don't want to.

Examples of this framework in action:

* How To TRAVEL THE WORLD! Without Spending a Fortune
* How To RENOVATE YOUR KITCHEN! Without Demoing Anything

Title: What You NEED To Know About FORGIVENESS In Your 20s

Hook score: -90

Why this flopped: I like this title, but if I had to guess, the
audience just isn't into forgiveness.

But here's the thing: sometimes your audience doesn't care about
your video topic, even though it might be exactly what they need
to hear.

In this case, you can try to write the title about the outcome or
pain, rather than the actual video subject.

Here are some examples:

""If your damaged soul is holding you back, you need to watch
this""

""Once I learned this, I stopped beating myself up""

""The Small Mindset Shift That Changed My Life Forever""

Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed this week's edition.

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

Title: most popular song each month in the 2020s

): +420

Why this works:

Interest - People love rankings like this. They're interesting
and they build curiosity.

Time Frame - The time frames of ""each month"" and ""in the 2020s""
makes this video more tangible and interesting.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the most
popular things in a certain time frame.

Examples of this framework in action:

* most popular TikTok trends each month in the 2020s
* the best NBA team each year in the last 50 years

): +446

Why this works:

Negativity - People love the controversy of things going too far.

Curiosity - This builds curiosity by asking a question.

Timeliness - Humanoid robots are trending more and more as
technology improves.

How you can use this framework: Ask if a trending, polarizing
topic has gone too far.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Have Betting Apps Gone Too Far?

A Simple Way To Get More Views

I A/B tested 103 YouTube titles and put all the results into an
ebook.

You'll see:

* The original title
* The test titles
* The before and after CTR
* And why the results turned out the way they did

Here's a sample page:

Title: This Cut Of Beef Is Better And Cheaper Than Prime Rib!

Framework: This (Entity) Is (More desirable) Than (Best current
option)!

): +946

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience loves prime rib, and something
better and cheaper than prime rib sounds awesome.

Curiosity - This builds curiosity because it doesn't tell you
what the cut of beef is, so you have to click to find out.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience that something
is better than what they currently like, but don't specify what
it is to build curiosity.

Examples of this framework in action:

* This Country Is Prettier And Cheaper Than Italy!
* This Camera is Better and Cheaper than the Sony A7!

Title: You Were the Smart Kid. So Why Do You Feel So Lost Now?

Feel So (Negative emotion) Now?

): +841

Why this works:

Negativity - This calls out a pain point that grabs people's
attention and interest.

Specific Audience - This calls out a very specific audience with
""You Were the Smart Kid,"" to grab the right audience's attention
and make them feel like this video was made for them.

Curiosity - This builds curiosity by asking a question.

How you can use this framework: Call out the right audience by
mentioning a very specific situation, then ask why they're
experiencing a specific pain point.

Examples of this framework in action:

* You Were the Athletic Kid. So Why Are You So Out Of Shape Now?
* You Used To Be Happy. So Why Are You So Down Now?

Title: Here's How To Make Your Assets Invisible From Creditors

Framework: Here's How To Make Your (Possession) Invisible From

​Hook score (

): +1863

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience wants to make their assets
invisible to creditors.

Negativity - This video is about avoiding a problem.

I also think a big part of this video's success is that the word
""invisible"" is such a great word. It feels secretive, powerful
and cool.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience how to do
something to avoid a problem, and use powerful, descriptive
language.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Here's How To Make Your Crypto Wallet Invisible From Scammers
* Here's How To Make Your Anxiety Invisible On Dates

Title: Make This Iconic Sandwich At Home!

Hook score: -75

Why this flopped: If you want to write great titles, you need to
know your audience. You need to know their fears, desires,
obstacles, and problems.

And keeping that in mind, I think one of the reasons this video
flopped is because making this iconic sandwich at home just isn't
a big problem for them.

It might've been better to make the focus of the title about a
different problem, like price or time:

""Make This Iconic Sandwich For Under $5!""

""Make This Iconic Sandwich In 5 Minutes!""

There's also the possibility that this creator's audience is into
big hunks of meat, not sandwiches, so maybe this video was doomed
from the start.

But that's why we do thorough research, right?

Title: 3 FASHION MISTAKES THAT ARE MAKING YOU LOOK OLDER THAN YOU

Framework: 3 (Niche) Mistakes That Are (Causing problem)

): +467

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Negativity - This uses negativity two ways:

* “Mistakes” grabs your attention and interest.
* It calls out a pain point — looking older than you are.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the
mistakes they’re making that are causing a problem.

): +520

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience wants to hear about the best San
Antonio suburbs.

Negativity - The ""worst"" San Antonio suburbs grabs attention
because this audience definitely does not want to move there.

Curiosity - Everybody likes to see how things rank and compare
against each other.

How you can use this framework: Rank the best and worst things in
your niche.

Examples of this framework in action:

): +625

Why this works:

Negativity - The big “STOP” in all caps does a great job of
grabbing your attention.

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you wonder what “these”
are. The first part is also a little counterintuitive — why would
you stop buying protein bars?

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience to stop doing
something they’re currently doing and try an alternative instead.

Examples of this framework in action:

* STOP planting tomatoes. Plant these instead.
* STOP practicing the piano. Try this instead.

Why this works:

Curiosity - This builds curiosity by asking a question many
people are probably wondering in the back of their minds.

Negativity - Climate change is a global problem that many people
are aware of and interested in.

How you can use this framework: Ask a question checking in on how
a big issue is doing.

Why this works:

Negativity - This calls out people experiencing a specific pain.

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you wonder what it is God
wants you to hear.

Authority - I'm not sure if this is just relevant to this niche
and this video, but if God wants you to hear something, that's a
pretty powerful sign you need to hear it.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience that if
they're craving something or experiencing a certain pain point,
they need to hear this.

Examples of this framework in action:

* If your business is stuck, Hormozi wants you to hear this.
* If you are craving more hip mobility, you need to watch this.

Title: 50 AND FABULOUS: COSY COMFY STYLE FOR WOMEN

Hook score: -64

Why this flopped: The best titles are clear and simple.

This title doesn’t really fit that.

“50 AND FABULOUS” is too clever and vague, and dilutes the main
idea of the title: “COSY COMFY STYLE FOR WOMEN.”

Here are some other options we could try:

We could try calling out a pain point and dropping in the current
year:

“How To Dress Stylish In 2025 (Without Being Uncomfortable)”

We could add a little curiosity by making it about a secret:

“The Secret To Dressing Stylish AND Comfy”

Or we could use a similar format to the outlier above this
section:

“If you want to dress stylish and cosy, you need to watch this.”

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

Title: Every Major Audio Effect Explained in 8 Minutes!

): +760

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience is into audio effects.

Time Frame - The time frame of 8 minutes does 3 things:

* Makes this video feel more tangible and interesting.
* Adds to the desire because it's relatively short.
* Adds some curiosity because there's contrast between ""Every
Major Audio Effect Explained"" (which feels like a lot) and ""in 8
Minutes"" (which feels like a short amount of time).

Epic - The word ""Every"" makes this video feel epic and complete.

How you can use this framework: Explain every element of
something in your niche in a short time frame.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Every Thunderbolts Character Explained in 8 Minutes!
* Every Squat Variation Explained in 8 Minutes!

): +781

Why this works:

Epic - People love epic things, and finding a snake bigger than
what was previously thought to be the biggest definitely
qualifies as extreme epic.

News - People love news and this feels like news.

Curiosity - This makes you wonder what the snake is and how big
it is. Plus, it's a little counterintuitive because this audience
knows that there are no snakes bigger than Titanoboa.

How you can use this framework: Share the news that you found or
did something more extreme than the previous record.

Examples of this framework in action:

* We Found a Pepper SPICIER Than Carolina Reaper!
* We Found a Mountain TALLER Than Everest!

): +2426

Why this works:

Negativity - Warnings like this do a great job of grabbing the
audience's attention.

Curiosity - This is a major cliffhanger and makes you wonder
what's wrong with canned sardines.

Urgency - If you eat sardines, there's some urgency here to watch
this before you eat your next can.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience not to do
something until they watch your video.

): +2640

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience would love to change their
language learning.

Curiosity - This builds curiosity two ways:

* ""Changed my Language Learning"" is open-ended and makes you
wonder what changed.
* It makes you wonder what this method is.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the
method that changed your journey.

Why this works:

Epic - Phrases like ""Renaissance Genius"" and ""Changed the World""
make this video feel exciting and epic.

How you can use this framework: Share the story of someone or an
interview, and hype the person up by giving them an epic label.

Editor's note: If the person you're making the video about is not
that well-known, I'd probably just model the second half of this
title (like the second example below).

Title: My MASSIVE Reptile Enclosure has 23 Animals Preparing for
a STORM!

Hook score: -74

Why this flopped: The #1 rule of writing YouTube titles: be
clear, not clever.

This title violates that rule.

This video is about ""the coolest jungle enclosure you've ever
seen"" (according to the intro).

Making the title about animals preparing for a storm is just
trying to be too clever.

If it were me, I'd make the title about how this is the coolest
reptile enclosure you've ever seen. And I'd probably use the word
""reptile"" and not ""jungle,"" because reptiles are the reason
people watch this channel.

Now, you could ask if making a video about jungle enclosures was
even a good idea in the first place, considering people watch
this channel to learn about reptiles, but that's a conversation
for another email.

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

uses all the titles from this newsletter, check out ​Creator

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience loves genius DIY home decor
ideas.

New - Everybody loves new things.

Curiosity - This builds curiosity two ways:

* It gets you interested in the idea, but doesn't give any
details, so you have to click to see what the idea is.
* It's counterintuitive - aren't shower curtains supposed to be
used in the bathroom, not the living room?

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about a genius
new counterintuitive idea.

Examples of this framework in action:

* The GENIUS new TikTok strategy people are using on YouTube!
* The GENIUS new dinner recipe people are using for breakfast!

Why this works:

Negativity - Warnings like this do a great job of grabbing the
audience's attention.

Specific Audience - Calling out a large, but specific audience,
like people selling their home after 63, can work well because it
makes them feel like you made the video specifically for them.

How you can use this framework: Warn a specific part of your
audience about doing a certain action.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Beware of The OUTRAGEOUS Charge for Booking Flights on Weekends
* Beware of The SEVERE Security Risk for older iPhones

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience wants to be fluent in English.

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you want to know which
way he's talking about.

Constraint - The constraint of the ""ONLY way"" makes this video so
much more challenging and interesting.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the ONLY
way to achieve a goal.

Why this works:

Curiosity - This simple title builds curiosity two ways:

* Talking about ""strange"" things builds curiosity.
* It opens a loop and makes you wonder what exactly is happening.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience that something
strange is happening in your niche.

): +1616

Why this works:

Desire - Most 52-year-olds would love to feel 32. Plus, they'd
love to know which lunch can help them achieve that.

Credibility - This one might be a bit of a stretch because it's
not exactly verifiable, but by claiming he feels 32, it makes him
sound more credible, so you're more interested in his opinion and
habits.

Contrast - The contrast between ""I'm 52"" and ""Feel 32"" builds
interest and curiosity here.

Daily - Talking about things you do every day makes the video
feel more tangible and interesting.

Specific - This isn't about vague health tips, this is about
something specific: the lunch he eats every day.

How you can use this framework: State why you're worth listening
to, then tell your audience about something specific you do every
day to help keep you in the state they want to be in.

Examples of this framework in action:

* 🔥 I’m 23 But Worth $10 Million —This is the Speaking Trick I
Use Every Day

Title: Is Waymo About to Dethrone Uber?

Hook score: -83

Why this flopped: This is a good title.

In fact, it's so good that a video by this channel using the same
exact format got 405K views: ""Is Chipotle About to Dethrone
McDonald's?""

So why did this one flop, but the Chipotle video went viral?

Here's my best guess: most of us love Chipotle. We read that
title and think, ""Yes! Go Chipotle!"" and then watch the video to
see how they're going to dethrone McDonald's.

But do people feel the same way about Waymo? Would you describe
yourself as being on Team Waymo?

Maybe I'm just a simple Florida man, but I don't think so. And
since nobody has strong emotions about Waymo, this title just
doesn't excite you as much as the Chipotle video.

So, how else could we title this video?

Well, we might not need to use Waymo in the title. We might be
better off using an easily understood label instead and adding
some more drama:

""This Small Startup Is About To Ruin Uber""

(Yes, I know Waymo isn't small, but compared to Uber it is. We
could also leave out the ""small"" if we wanted.)

Or, we could focus the title wholly on Uber:

""Uber Is About To Collapse""

The lesson: modeling proven formats is the best way to come up
with great video ideas, but ideally, you know exactly why the
original video did so well, and your idea matches those
conditions.

Oh, and have a few backup titles just in case.

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Negativity - People can't get enough of controversial things like
cheating scandals.

Extreme & Epic - ""BIGGEST"" and ""in Golf History"" make this video
feel extreme, epic, and interesting.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the
biggest cheating scandals (or other dramatic, controversial
things) in your niche's history.

Why this works:

Negativity - Killing something great brings some interesting
conflict here.

Curiosity - This builds curiosity two ways:

* It's counterintuitive - why would you kill something great?
* It opens a loop and makes you want to know why and how we did
this.

How you can use this framework: Explain how we killed something
great in your niche.

): +2448

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience would love for YouTube to change
their lives and to be a full-time creator.

Time Frame - The time frame of 4 months adds to the desire (it's
a relatively short time to have your life changed) and it makes
this video feel more tangible, real and interesting.

Curiosity - This opens a loop and builds two questions in the
audience's mind:

* How did his life change?
* How did YouTube change his life?

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience how something
changed your life in a relatively short time frame.

Examples of this framework in action:

* HOW a Sewing Machine Changed My Life (in 2 months) | My Journey
to Full-Time Business Owner

Title: Back on Icon (Episode 558)

Hook score: -99

Why this flopped: This is a particular pet peeve of mine: posting
podcast episodes on your non-podcast channel.

YouTube wants you to binge watch channels, but when you post
different formats (i.e. vlogs, podcasts, video essays, talking
head listicles, etc), it makes that a lot harder for the viewers.

The best channels, like MrBeast, Diary of a CEO, all post one
format. I'm not saying you can't publish multiple formats on your
channel, I'm just saying success on YouTube will typically come a
lot easier if you don't.

And not to mention, this title could be a lot better. Instead of
focusing the title on the creators, I'd focus it on the most
interesting part of the video.

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

): +476

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience is into Dollar Tree planters.

Social Proof - This title makes these planters seem even cooler
because ""everyone"" is grabbing them.

Curiosity - This title builds curiosity in two ways:

* The fact that these planters are huge makes them more unique
and intriguing.
* It opens a loop and makes you wonder why everyone is grabbing
these planters.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience why everyone
is doing something, but leave the ""why"" open-ended.

Why this works:

Negativity - This title is full of drama and controversy, which
people love.

Curiosity - Instead of saying the channel name, this title gives
it an extreme, unique label: ""The Most Hated Eating Channel on
TikTok"".

This makes this title easy to understand and also makes you
wonder what the channel is.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the most
hated (or similarly negative) thing in your space.

Examples of this framework in action:

* The Most Controversial Workout Routine on Instagram

Why this works:

Curiosity - This builds curiosity and makes you wonder what
changes.

Specific Audience - Calling out people in a specific situation is
a great way to grab their attention and get them to watch your
video.

Epic - Saying ""Everything"" changes, instead of just ""Things,""
makes this video feel more epic and interesting.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience why everything
changes if your viewer is in a specific situation.

Why this works:

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you wonder why amateurs
don't create clubhead speed.

Beginners - Calling out beginners (or amateurs, in this case) is
a great way to make a large segment of the audience feel like you
made your video specifically for them.

Desire - This creator's audience would love more clubhead speed.

Negativity - There's a bit of FOMO here because if you're an
amateur golfer, you feel like you're missing out on clubhead
speed.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience why 99% of
amateurs or beginners don't do something they're trying to do.

): +9461

Why this works:

Curiosity - This title builds curiosity in three ways:

* It asks a question.
* It's a little counterintuitive — why would new cars never sell?
* ""Behind the Dealer Lot"" makes you feel like you're getting in
on a secret.

You could also say that ""Behind the Dealer Lot"" brings in a
little credibility because it feels like you're getting this
information from a credible source, but I'd guess the curiosity
is what really made this title successful.

How you can use this framework: Ask your audience what happens to
cool things that are never sold, used, or whatever people would
expect them to do.

Examples of this framework in action:

* What Happens to UNRELEASED Movies? Inside Producer Vaults!
* What happens to filet mignons that get sent back to the

Title: The Cost of Letting Go, Why Retirement After 60 Is SO Hard

Hook score: -88

Why this flopped: I think this title flopped for two reasons.

First, it's too vague. ""The Cost of Letting Go"" isn't specific or
clear enough to grab the audience's attention, tell them what the
video is about, and get them to click.

And second, it's too complicated. I think it'd probably do better
if it was just ""Why Retirement After 60 Is SO Hard"".

Having the extra words at the beginning of the title makes it
harder to read and waters down its punchiness.

The lesson? Write short, clear, punchy, emotional titles for your
videos.

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

Why this works:

Curiosity - A building that shouldn't exist is counterintuitive.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about
something that shouldn't exist.

): +494

Why this works:

Negativity - People love drama, like cancelling things.

Time Frame - The time frame of ""seconds before boarding""
amplifies the drama.

Curiosity - This starts a story, but doesn't finish it, so you
have to click and watch the video to find out why.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience that you
canceled or quit something at the last second.

Examples of this framework in action:

* We Backed Out Of Buying This Business Just Before Closing
* He Broke Up With Her The Morning Of Their Wedding

Title: 50mm & The Biggest Mistake You’re Making

): +620

Why this works:

Negativity - Nobody wants to make a mistake, so mistakes make for
great topics.

Curiosity - This builds curiosity because it's about the biggest
mistake (which makes it extreme and unique), plus it's only about
one mistake, which makes it more specific and interesting.

How you can use this framework: Mention a product or thing your
audience is interested in and tell them about the biggest mistake
they're making.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Buying a House & The Biggest Mistake You’re Making
* Squats & The Biggest Mistake You’re Making

): +827

Why this works:

Authority - A priest is someone whose opinion many people value.

Curiosity - People love to see how different things rank and
compare to each other.

Negativity - Controversial things like bad addictions make for
interesting topics.

How you can use this framework: Have an authority figure rank
controversial things.

): +969

Why this works:

Curiosity - This builds curiosity 3 ways:

* It makes you wonder what ""this"" is.
* It makes you wonder how people will treat you differently.
* It's counterintuitive that doing something once will have such
a big impact.

Desire - This creator's audience wants people to treat them
differently, and this difference is assumed to be a good change.
Plus, it says you only have to do it once, which adds even more
to the desire. It feels like you're getting a lot for a little.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience to do
something once and then watch a desirable change.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Do This Once & Watch Your Golf Swing Change Forever
* Do This Once & Never Struggle With Procrastination Again

Flop of the Week

)
Title: They Don't Want You To Know This Secret

Hook score: -92

Why this flopped: This title seems good, but I think it's too
vague.

When you're trying to build curiosity in your audience's mind,
you need to be in the middle between these two options:

* ""I have no idea what this is about, I don't care.""
* ""I know exactly what this is about, I don't care.""

This title falls too close to the first option.

Neither the thumbnail nor the title gives you any information or
context for what this video is about, so it's not that
compelling.

Although the above title (""Do This Once & Watch How People Treat
You Differently"") from the same channel is also vague, it does
give you two details that make it more interesting:

* It tells you how often to do ""this"" (once)
* It tells you what the result will be (people will treat you
differently)

If I were rewriting this title, I'd give more context about what
the secret is, who ""they"" are, or what the stakes or impact of
the secret is.

Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

* There's contrast between AI and real life.

Authority - The fact that bakeries (not just the creator) are
recreating these ai cakes makes this feel more legit.

How you can use this framework: Make something cool with AI, then
hire a professional to make it in real life.

Examples of this framework in action:

* I Paid Designers $5,000 To Recreate AI Outfits!
* I Paid a Contractor $50,000 To Make My AI Backyard!

Title: Every Daily Habit That Destroys Your Brain Explained in 10

Framework: Every (Action) That (Unwanted result) Explained in 10
Minutes

): +912

Why this works:

Negativity - Nobody wants to destroy their brain.

Tangible - Titles that are specific and tangible often do well
because the viewer can easily envision what the video will be
about (which makes them want to watch it more).

This title has two phrases in particular that make it tangible:

* ""Daily"" - Habits make for powerful topics, but ""daily"" makes
these habits even more specific and attention-grabbing.
* ""10 Minutes"" - the time frame of 10 minutes makes it even more
tangible.

The relatively short time frame also adds a constraint, which
makes it seem more challenging and interesting, and makes it more
desirable because you feel like you're getting a lot for a
little.

Relatability - The thumbnail grabs attention because most of us
do at least one of these habits.

Epic - The word ""Every"" makes this video feel more epic and
complete.

How you can use this framework: Explain every daily habit that
has a big impact in a short time frame.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Every Daily Habit That Destroys Your Sleep Explained in 10
Minutes
* Every Daily Habit That Destroys Your Relationship Explained in
10 Minutes

): +2391

Why this works:

Curiosity - This builds curiosity by asking a big question many
people have asked themselves at some time.

How you can use this framework: Ask a big, but simple question
your audience has wondered about before.

Examples of this framework in action:

* why are some countries better to visit than others?
* why do some photos just look so good?

)
I think there are two things that made title B get a higher CTR
than title A:

* It refutes an objection. If you think your camera can't make
cinematic videos, this squashes that objection and gives you
hope.
* There's something epic and interesting about absolute words
like ""ANY"". Other absolute words that often work well are
""always,"" ""every,"" ""never,"" and ""only."" (You can see a few of
these in the titles featured earlier in this newsletter.)

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

uses all the titles from this newsletter, check out ​Creator

): +301

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience would love to beat Instagram's
algorithm.

Timeliness - This title lets the audience know this is relevant
right now because he drops in the current year.

New Opportunity - New opportunities, like, ""The NEW Way To Beat
Instagram’s Algorithm,"" offer hope because if you've failed at
beating the Instagram algorithm so far, maybe now you'll be able
to beat it using this new way.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the new
way to achieve a goal that's working right now.

): +501

Why this works:

Negativity - This leverages negativity to grab your attention two
ways:

* It's about thieves and victims.
* It's about avoiding mistakes.

This title is also effective because it's subtly persuasive. It's
not trying to convince you to follow these tips to avoid getting
robbed.

It's about what the thieves do, then you can choose for yourself
to avoid those mistakes.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about how the
enemy makes their decisions so they can avoid a bad situation.

Examples of this framework in action:

* How Computer Hackers Pick Their Victims (Avoid These Mistakes!)
* How Hiring Managers Identify Bad Candidates (Avoid These

): +2657

Why this works:

Negativity - Being told you're in a war grabs your attention, and
not even knowing it doubles up on that ominous feeling.

Curiosity - ""(and You Don’t Even Know It)"" makes you feel like
you're getting in on a secret.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience that they're
in a bad situation and they don't even know it.

): +6563

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Desire - This creator's audience would love to melt their belly
fat.

Negativity - This isn't about habits to get a 6-pack (desire),
this is about habits to melt belly fat (pain point).

Specific - Making this video specifically about ""morning"" habits
makes this more specific, tangible, and interesting.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about specific
habits that can help them solve a problem or achieve a goal.

): +26000

Why this works:

Credibility - Experiments like this are more persuasive and
credible because the creator actually went out and did something
(they're not just preaching their opinion).

Curiosity - This builds curiosity two ways:

* It asks a question.
* There's contrast between suit and no suit.

How you can use this framework: Test two opposite options and
report if there's a difference.

Examples of this framework in action:

* I tested Expensive vs Cheap Wine — Could I tell the difference?
* I tested AI vs Human-Written Resume — Which got more
interviews?

Title: 10 DEADLY Travel Mistakes NOBODY Is Talking About

Hook score: -89

Why this flopped: This title follows a proven format, but I think
there's one problem with it: it's too broad.

There are three ways this might've done better by being more
specific:

#1: More specific topic

Looking at some of his recent successful videos, I wonder if this
would've gotten more views if he decided to focus on airport or
hotel mistakes instead of general travel mistakes.

#2: More specific title

Even if he kept the same topic, it might help to write the title
around one specific mistake. For example, ""Why I'll Never Rent A
Scooter In Southeast Asia Again.""

When I make list videos like this, I typically have a few
specific titles about a single topic from the video and a few
broad list titles to test out.

#3: More specific thumbnail

Just like writing the title about one specific point, it could
also be worth making the thumbnail about one specific point.
Something like, ""Never Do This In Mexico,"" and the thumbnail
image is doing something many people like to do in Mexico.

In summary, you might consider testing broad vs. narrow titles on
your channel to see what resonates best with your audience.

Title: You Can Change Your Finances in 6 Months… Here’s How

Framework: You Can Change (Possession) in 6 Months… Here’s How

): +504

Why this works:

Desire - People love transformation (the word ""change"" promises
this) and making more money.

Time Frame - The relatively short time frame of 6 months adds to
the desire, plus it makes this video feel more tangible and
interesting.

Curiosity - This builds curiosity two ways:

* It has an open-ended ""Here's How"" at the end that makes you
want to know more.
* ""Change Your Finances"" is vague and makes you wonder how your
finances will change.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience how they can
change a problem area in their life in a relatively short time.

Examples of this framework in action:

* You Can Change Your Body in 6 Months… Here’s How
* You Can Change Your Golf Swing in 1 Session… Here’s How

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience wants to learn how to take

Credibility - This creator proves why she's worth listening to by
mentioning that she got straight As.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience how you did

): +877

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Negativity - This is about moving away from pain — stopping
wasting evenings — as opposed to moving towards pleasure, like
being more productive in the evenings.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about a list
of things you did to stop experiencing a problem.

Examples of this framework in action:

* 8 things I did to stop girls ghosting me after the first date
* 8 things I did to stop sales prospects telling me ""I'll think

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly

Nostalgia - ""FORGOTTEN Vegetables Your Grandparents Grew""
leverages nostalgia to get you emotionally invested in this
video.

Curiosity - ""FORGOTTEN"" adds a little mystery to this title.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about
forgotten, nostalgic things that need to come back.

): +18,272

Why this works:

Negativity - This is all about solving a problem.

Curiosity - This builds curiosity two ways:

* It's counterintuitive because many people might think it's best
to talk.
* It opens a loop because it makes you want to know what ""this""
is.

Editor's picky note: if I was writing this title I'd use ""but""
instead of ""&"" because typically ""but"" adds more conflict and
tension than ""and,"" which makes for a better title.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience that when
they're solving a problem, don't do a logical, assumed solution,
but try ""this"" instead.

Examples of this framework in action:

* When Growing Tomatoes, Don’t Just Water Them & Try This Instead
* When Learning Piano, Don’t Practice Every Day But Try This
Instead

)
""The Truth About"" is a proven framework, so why did this title
not win?

Two thoughts:

* Sometimes popular frameworks can get played out and people lose
interest in them (I think that's happening a little bit with ""the
truth about"" in some niches).
* Sometimes good titles just don't do that well for reasons that
are hard to understand.

In this case, I tested a bold, opinionated, open-ended statement
and it worked.

Plus, the word ""weird"" often works well.

Why this works:

Curiosity - This title builds curiosity by asking a question.

Timeliness - This doubles up on timeliness:

* They dropped the current year in the title.
* It's about a topic that's currently going through some
turbulent times.

Negativity - There's a hint of fear here because if you're
already on the path of learning to code, you might be wondering
if it'll be an obsolete skill soon.

How you can use this framework: Ask if something volatile is
still worth doing in the current year.

): +853

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Urgency - Saying men learn these ""Too Late"" adds a little urgency
for you to watch this right now.

Negativity - ""Brutal"" adds some drama and controversy here.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about brutal
truths they learn too late.

Desire - Some people in this creator's audience are looking for
jobs or gigs.

cool. It wasn't just that he thought it was cool — somebody else
thought it was so good they offered him a job.

Title: The ONLY Ecommerce Email Marketing Guide You'll Need

Hook score: -94

Why this flopped: There are a few reasons why this might have
flopped:

* In the last year or so, this is the only video with ""email
marketing"" in the title. It might not be the best topic for his
channel.
* It might be too far down in the funnel. Optimizing your email
marketing has a lot less of a potential audience than, say,
finding products to drop ship.
* It might not be compelling enough. I love using ""ONLY"" in
titles, but it's possible the title just isn't sexy enough.

Now the first two reasons this might've flopped are about the
topic, but there's not much we can do about that now that the
video is already published. So let's brainstorm some ideas to
make the title more compelling.

We could add a benefit:

""Copy This Email Marketing Sequence To Blow Up Your Ecom Store In
2025""

We could add some FOMO:

""The $1,000,000 Ecommerce Email Strategy You're Probably Not
Using""

Or we could add more curiosity and be a little more broadly
appealing and vague:

""The Simplest Strategy To 10X Your Ecom Store""

We launched a brand new title generator in Creator Hooks Pro and
you can get your first month for $1 if you want to try it out.

Here are 5 things we've changed:

1. We'll create a custom style guide for you

You can select your channel and we'll create a custom style guide
so you can generate titles in your channel's style.

2. It follows what you put in the video description closer

We've updated the generator so that it'll more closely follow
what you put in the video description so you can get more
accurate title suggestions for your video.

3. You can add custom instructions

This lets you customize the results you're getting. For example,
you can ask it to start every title with a certain word or
phrase.

4. We've redesigned the title suggestions to make them easier to
read

* If the click trigger is blue, that title uses curiosity to get
people to click.
* If it’s red, it uses negativity.
* If it’s green, it uses desire.

5. You can reword titles

We added a little ""Reword"" button that will generate 10 new
titles using slightly different wording.

This can help you find the perfect way to word your title.

Just hover over the ""..."" menu on the right to see it.

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

Title: I Bought Cat Products With No Reviews

): +550

Why this works:

Curiosity - There's a lot of tension and uncertainty in buying
products with no reviews because we don't yet know what they're
like.

Negativity - ""No Reviews"" and the thumbnail text both hint that
these are bad products, and people love drama like that.

How you can use this framework: Buy or do something that very few
people have done before.

Why this works:

Credibility - This isn't just a review of Duolingo. He shows that
he's used it for a long time, which makes this video more
trustworthy.

Time Frame - The long time frame of 2,000 days provides
credibility and makes this video feel more tangible and specific.

Curiosity - This builds curiosity by asking a question.

How you can use this framework: Do something for a long time and
ask if it actually worked.

Examples of this framework in action:

make them easier to read:

* Blue click triggers = curiosity-based titles
* Red = negativity-based titles
* Green = desire-based titles

2. We added the ability to reword titles so you can find the
perfect way to word your titles.

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience would love to get rich in the AI
era.

Timeliness - This leverages timeliness in two ways:

* It's about a trending topic — AI.
* It was published in the beginning of the year and drops in the
current year to let you know this is relevant right now.

New - People love new things, like ""the New Era of A.I."" here.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience how to achieve
a goal in this new environment.

Title: Donating PetSmart Toys to a Cat Cafe

Hook score: -92

Why this flopped: This is a nice title, but it's too bland and
boring.

There's no drama, curiosity or any strong emotion to make you
click.

Here are some alternate titles that could've been more emotional:

""Cats React To Weird New Petsmart Toys""

""Homeless Cats React To New Petsmart Toys""

""I Donated Every Petsmart Cat Toy To A Cat Cafe""

""10 Minutes of Homeless Cats Playing With New Toys""

Now all these titles may not necessarily fit this video, but
that's why it's so important to come up with a clickable title
BEFORE you make a video.

To avoid a flop like this, make sure your title is emotional
enough to get people to click.

Title: Everyone's Saying The Same Thing About The Fantastic Four

Framework: Everyone's Saying The Same Thing About (Trending
Entity)

): +313

Why this works:

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you want to know what
everyone is saying.

Social Proof - Since ""everyone"" is saying it, it must be
interesting, right?

Timeliness - This video was published right after the Fantastic
Four Teaser was published.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience that
everyone's saying the same thing about something currently
trending.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Everyone's Saying The Same Thing About The 2025 MLB Season
* Everyone's Saying The Same Thing About The New Macbook

): +945

Why this works:

Extreme - Bold, extreme statements like this often make for great
titles on YouTube.

Curiosity - Starting this title with ""Why"" is a simple way to add
a little curiosity.

Controversial - Some people would disagree with this statement,
which often makes for a great YouTube title.

How you can use this framework: Make a bold, polarizing statement
about why one thing crushes all other options.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Why the Espresso Crushes Every Other Coffee Drink
* Why Poland Is The Best European Country To Visit

): +1660

Why this works:

Negativity & Specific - Calling out a group of people with a
specific pain point (like people who've never been in a
relationship) is a great way to grab your ideal audience's
attention.

Timeliness - This video was published at the end of 2024 when
2025 was on everybody's mind, so dropping ""(2025)"" at the end of
the title also grabs the audience's attention.

Curiosity - ""watch this"" builds curiosity because it's vague and
open-ended.

How you can use this framework: Call out a group of people with a
specific pain point and tell them to watch this. Bonus points if
it's near the turn of the year and you drop in the current or
upcoming year.

Examples of this framework in action:

* if you have less than $100K saved up, watch this (2025)
* if you suck at playing guitar, watch this (2025)

): +2063

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience would love to build a DIY
fireplace.

Curiosity - There's a bit of contrast and conflict between ""they
said it couldn't be done"" and ""I built this anyway"" that makes
you wonder how they did it.

How you can use this framework: Do something your audience would
love to do, but people said couldn't be done.

Examples of this framework in action:

* They Said It Couldn’t Be Done… But I Got 100K Subs on a New

): +8465

Why this works:

Timeliness - This video is about a trending topic, but they
double down on that by dropping in the current year to let you
know this is about what's going on right now.

Negativity - Since tech jobs are struggling right now, this is a
controversial topic that grabs lots of attention.

Curiosity - This title is vague and open-ended, which makes you
want to know what's going on with tech jobs.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the
reality of a struggling or controversial topic right now.

Title: i read 365 self help books, these are the best ones

Hook score: -97

Why this flopped: I think this is a great title, so why did it
flop?

Well, it's possible this creator's audience doesn't like the term
""self help"" books.

Or maybe ""these are best ones"" just isn't spicy or specific
enough.

Here are some alternate titles she could try:

""5 Underrated Books That Will Change Your Life""

""i read 365 books, these 5 will change your life""

""if you’re feeling stuck in life, read these books (2025)""

But maybe her audience just isn't interested in a list of books
that could change their life, or the thumbnail wasn't quite
compelling enough, or there was something wrong with the content
that turned viewers off.

Sometimes good videos, titles and thumbnails miss the mark for
some combination of reasons we don't understand.

Alright, enough armchair titling, that wraps up this week’s
Creator Hooks!

Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed this week's edition.

Title: What Actually Is Blue Raspberry?

): +610

Why this works:

Curiosity - This builds curiosity by asking a question about
something that everybody knows of, but nobody actually knows
about.

How you can use this framework: Ask what something that everybody
knows about, but doesn't know well, actually is.

Examples of this framework in action:

): +1387

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Desire - This creator's audience is into hacks that can change
their life.

Curiosity - Vaseline is a pretty common, basic item, so the fact
that hacks with it can ""change your life"" builds curiosity
because of the contrast and counterintuitiveness.

Broadly appealing - Almost everybody has Vaseline lying around
the house somewhere, so this is relevant for a large potential
audience.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about hacks
using a common item that can change their life.

* 8 Baking Soda Hacks That Will Change Your Life
* 5 Journaling Hacks That Will Change Your Life

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Curiosity - An easy way to build curiosity is to talk about the
future.

Desire - This creator's audience is into technology trends.

""New"" - Everybody loves new things.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the top
new trends of your niche's future.

Title: How A Domino's Pizza Mascot Caused A Hostage Situation

Hook score: -78

Why this flopped: There are two main reasons I think this
flopped:

The first is that it's a complicated title. Specifically,
""Domino's Pizza Mascot"" makes for a long and confusing subject.
Compare this to the other video from this channel we featured
earlier: ""What Actually Is Blue Raspberry?""

The subject ""Blue Raspberry"" is much simpler and easier to
understand.

Could they have just used, ""Domino's Mascot""? That might've been
better.

But there's a bigger reason I think this flopped: it's about a
hostage situation.

The audience watches this channel for food videos, not true crime
videos. Even though this is technically about a food chain, the
main story is still a crime story.

To avoid these mistakes:

* Make sure your titles are simple and easy to read.
* Know why your audience watches your videos and deliver on that
premise in each video.

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

Why this works:

Curiosity - This title builds curiosity by asking a question.

Negativity - People love controversial topics like these.

How you can use this framework: Ask what the difference is
between two options. Bonus points if the options are currently
trending and/or polarizing options.

): +460

Why this works:

Curiosity - This builds curiosity by asking a simple, yet
powerful question. It's also counterintuitive that singing would
be dead because it's such a staple in human history.

Negativity - People love to watch videos about controversial
takes like this.

How you can use this framework: Ask if something simple, yet very
common is dead. This is especially helpful in spaces where
technology, especially AI, is disrupting.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Is graphic design dead?
* Is writing dead?

): +1344

Why this works:

Curiosity - This title builds curiosity 2 ways:

* It's counterintuitive — you wouldn't expect the shortest NBA
player to be doing anything remarkable.
* It opens a loop. What is ""the impossible""? What's he actually
doing?

Epic - ""Doing The Impossible"" makes this video feel epic and
exciting.

Extreme - This isn't about ""A Short NBA Player,"" it's about ""The
Shortest NBA Player."" This title, being extreme, makes the video
clearer and more interesting.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience that an
underdog is doing something amazing.

): +2130

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Desire - This channel's audience would love to get rich with real
estate.

""Method"" - My guess is that ""ways"", ""tips"", etc. are a little
played out, but ""methods"" is a new way of saying the same thing
we know works.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the 4
methods to achieve a goal through a specific avenue.

): +9752

Why this works:

Epic & Extreme - ""The Most Insane"" and ""Ever Made"" both make this
video feel epic, extreme, and awesome.

And I normally don't like using periods at the end of titles, but
in this case, it adds to the epicness by giving this statement an
""End of discussion"" feeling.

Desire - This creator's audience wants to learn about amazing
cameras.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the most
insane thing ever made or done.

Examples of this framework in action:

* The Most Insane Game Ever Made.
* The Most Insane Country I Ever Visited.

Title: Some videos LOOK live, but they're not meant as such. So
for requests, double check!

Hook score: -93

Why this flopped: Can you tell me in one second exactly what this
video is about?

No.

Let's look at the title from this channel we mentioned earlier in
this email:

""Is singing dead?""

Can you tell me in one second exactly what this video is about?

Yes!

And to make things even worse, I watched the first minute of this
video and still couldn't tell you what it was about.

So to avoid a flop like this, make sure your title is simple and
clear, and in your intro reassure the audience that they're
watching the right video.

Title: 5 Simple (and kinda weird) Dutch habits to Simplify Your
Life

Framework: 5 Simple (and kinda weird) [Specific entity] [Actions

): +556

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Curiosity - The word ""weird"" is a simple, but great way to build
curiosity, and this title uses it perfectly with the ""(and kinda
weird)"" bit. Also, the phrase ""Dutch habits"" is very specific,
which adds to the curiosity.

Desire - This creator's audience would love to simplify their
life. Plus habits often make for great topics because they're
tangible and people like the idea of them.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about simple,
weird, and specific habits or other things they can do to achieve
a goal.

* 5 Simple (and kinda weird) Kenyan habits to Run Faster

): +702

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience would love to become
millionaires.

Refute Objection - Many people might think ""You can't become a
millionaire on a 9-5 salary, you have to start a big business or
do some shady stuff."" This title refutes that objection.

Constraint - Similar to the point above, people might think being
on a 9-5 salary is a constraint to becoming a millionaire, which
makes this video way more interesting.

Resonates with the audience - The audience is probably on a 9-5
salary, they want to become millionaires, but they don't have
much, so the thumbnail text and title both resonate with the
audience.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience how you
achieved a big goal even with a common objection or constraint.

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Negativity - People love drama and controversy like this. Plus,
this sparks the fearful question, ""Is my car on this list?""

Authority - This leverages the authority of Consumer Reports to
be more credible.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about a list
of negative things according to an authoritative source.

): +3696

Why this works:

Curiosity - This leverages curiosity in two ways:

* ""Last Secrets Revealed"" uses secrecy to build curiosity.
* ""Unpublished Archives"" also makes you feel like you're getting
in on a secret because these archives were ""unpublished.""

Authority - This leverages the name recognition and notoriety of
Hitler.

Scarcity - The fact that these are his last secrets makes them
feel unique and scarce, which makes this video feel more
interesting.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about
something notorious or scandalous that was just revealed.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Amelia Earhart's Last Secrets Revealed in Recovered Radio Logs​

* Leonardo da Vinci's Biggest Creativity Secret Revealed in

Title: 13 DEADLY Mistakes Manual Drivers Make (that Kills Your
Car)

Hook score: -99

Why this flopped: Here's a quick story:

I had a dog channel a while ago and made a video for puppy
owners. It flopped horribly, even though it was a good title and
good content.

I'm pretty sure this happened because it was such a small segment
of the audience. And I think this is the same issue here.

It's a good title, but manual drivers are such a small segment of
this channel's audience that it just didn't quite get off the
ground.

It's great to make videos for specific segments of your audience
sometimes, but know that if the segment is too small it can also
result in a flop like this or my puppy video.

Big news — we just launched a new title generator and an idea
generator in Creator Hooks Pro.

Here’s what’s different about the new title generator:

* It lets you select your channel and creates a custom style
guide to generate titles in your channel's style
* It produces titles that better match what you put in your
description
* It lets you give custom instructions, so if you wanted to avoid
a certain word, use certain words, etc. you can put them in there

The idea generator shows a selection of topics relevant to your
channel that you can click to get ideas.

There’s also a “Surprise me” option that will give you ideas
based on what’s worked for your channel.

You can try the new title generator here:

Why this works:

Credibility - This isn't just theory, he actually tried these
ideas and got real results with them. Also, trying 50 business
ideas tells us that he's put a lot of effort into this and is
someone worth listening to.

Desire - This creator's audience loves business ideas and would
love to get rich from their business.

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you want to know what
these 3 business ideas are.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about how you
tried many of the options they're considering and which ones you
were successful with.

between November of the previous year and February or so of the
current year.

New - Everybody loves new things.

rules or other things for the upcoming year they must know.

Framework: How Did the Average (Entity) (Activity) in Every (Time
Period)?

): +572

Why this works:

Curiosity - This builds curiosity by asking a question.

""Every"" - The word ""every"" gives this video a feeling of epicness
and completeness.

How you can use this framework: Analyze how an average person or
thing did an action in every time period.

Examples of this framework in action:

* What Was An Average NBA Game Like in Every Decade?
* What could you do on every version of the iPhone?

Title: Give Me 9 Minutes, and 2025 Will Be Your Best Year Yet

): +1322

Why this works:

Time Frame - The time frame of ""9 minutes"" makes this video feel
more tangible and interesting.

Timeliness - This was published at the end of 2024 when everybody
was excited about the upcoming year. It's a time when people are
planning for and getting excited about the future.

Desire - This creator's audience would love to have their best
year yet.

Curiosity - This title builds curiosity because it promises a big
benefit, but is vague about what you'll get from watching this
video and how you'll get it.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience to give you a
few minutes and they'll get a big benefit. Bonus points if that
benefit is relevant to what's going on right now.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Give Me 14 Minutes, and You'll Make Your First $1,000,000 In
2025
* Give Me 9 Minutes, and You'll Be Fluent In Spanish In 2025

): +19901

Why this works:

Credibility - This isn't just theory — she actually bought 22
rental units, which answers the question, ""why should I listen to
you?""

Negativity - Regret is such a powerful negative emotion people
want to avoid, so this grabs attention.

Curiosity - ""Here's Why..."" adds some curiosity at the end and
makes you want to know why.

How you can use this framework: Do something your audience would
like to do, but explain why you regret it.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Finally Got a 6 Pack and Now I Regret It. Here’s Why…
* I Visited Every State in America and Now I Regret It. Here’s
Why…

Title: What Happened to the Merrill Lynch Mansion?

Hook score: -72

Why this flopped: If you want to build curiosity, there's a sweet
spot you gotta land in: your audience needs to have some idea of
what you're talking about to be interested, but not know too much
that they already know the answer.

In this case, I'd assume most people have no idea what happened
to the Merrill Lynch mansion or know anything about it, so their
curiosity isn't piqued enough.

This title might work if it was about something more familiar,
like the first White House, but obviously that's not the case.

So instead, I'd try to make this title about something more
familiar or easily understandable, like:

""The Most Insane Mansion In Southampton""

or

""Inside This $40,000,000 New York Mansion""

): +427

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Desire - This creator's audience wants to learn about the habits
of wealthy people so they can become wealthy too.

Curiosity - It's not obvious that somebody is ""quietly wealthy,""
so this makes you feel like you're getting in on a secret.

Authority - This title uses the authority of ""wealthy
individuals"" to get credibility.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the
habits of secretly successful people they want to be like.

Why this works:

Curiosity - This builds curiosity because it opens up so many
questions:

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about
something that will change your industry and in the thumbnail be
vague about what this thing is.

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly

in on a secret.

and the Andy Griffith Show, which gets them excited about this

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about things

Why this works:

Negativity - This is all about a problem and controversy, which
grabs people's attention.

Confirms Suspicions - Some people are already thinking this to
themselves, so this title resonates with that feeling.

How you can use this framework: Make a bold, negative statement
that connects with a struggle people in your audience are
experiencing.

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience wants exercise routines.

Time Frame - Specifying this exercise routine is 25 minutes makes
this video more tangible and desirable.

Specific Audience - Calling out ""Seniors Over 60"" makes it clear
who this video is for and makes them more likely to click.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the best
thing for a specific group that takes a specific amount of time.

Title: Optimal Order Of Investing For Self-Employed

Hook score: -80

Why this flopped: The best YouTube titles are clear and bold.

""Optimal"" isn't very clear or bold.

A more clear, bold way to put it could be: ""The Best Order Of
Investing For Self-Employed.""

It's also possible this just isn't a very exciting angle. We
could add some more curiosity and excitement into this title like
this:

""Invest In This First If You're Self-Employed""

This title narrows the focus to just one thing thing to invest in
first which makes it both more clear and more intriguing.

Lesson: write clear, bold titles about exciting topics.

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

uses all the titles from this newsletter, check out ​Creator

Title: Archeologists Uncover How Napoleon Lost At Waterloo

Framework: (Authority Figures) Uncover (Explanation of dramatic
event)

): +303

Why this works:

Authority & Credibility - Since archeologists ""uncovered""
something, it feels like this video has more authority and
credibility than just a random historian's opinion.

Negativity - This is about drama — a famous person's big loss —
which people love.

Curiosity - This also makes you wonder what they uncovered.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience how authority
figures uncovered or discovered something dramatic.

): +630

Why this works:

Authority - ""Studios"" are big authority figures in the VFX world.

Negativity - This is about drama and controversy — studios
ignoring a popular software.

Curiosity - This builds curiosity by asking a question.

How you can use this framework: Ask why the leaders in your niche
are ignoring a solution lots of people like and use.

Why this works:

News - This title is news and people love news.

Epic & Extreme - ""CRAZIEST Update in History"" feels epic,
extreme, and exciting.

to know what the update is.

Why this works:

Negativity - This hints that something many people do might be
causing a problem.

Tangible - ""What staying up all night does to your brain"" feels
more tangible and specific than just, ""What staying up all night
does to you."" This builds more curiosity and makes this title
more interesting.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience what a common
or innocent mistake they're making does to something specific of
theirs.

): +9851

Why this works:

Negativity - This is about a problem many people have.

Curiosity - This implies that this video is a solution for people
who feel time slips away, but doesn't say anything about the
actual solution, so you've gotta click to see what it is.

Being vague like this can backfire, but the thumbnail text
mentions a benefit and the problem presented in the tile (feeling
time slip away) is such a common and tangible problem that this
title gets away with it.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience if they're
experiencing a certain problem, watch your video.

* If You FEEL Like Your Biceps Aren't Growing, Watch This!

Title: Why Tutankhamun's Tomb Is The Biggest Discovery Of All
Time

Hook score: -91

Why this flopped: I like this title — ""biggest discovery of all
time"" is an exciting promise.

But apparently the audience didn't like it.

Now it could've been because everyone knows him as ""King Tut"" and
not ""Tutankhamun."" If it were me, I would've gone with his
nickname instead of his full name.

But since they used ""King Tut"" in the thumbnail, I don't think
that's the main reason this video flopped.

It was probably because the topic or angle didn't resonate. And
since we're stuck with the topic, let's try some different
angles.

We could try to zoom in on a specific detail:

""This Tiny Box In King Tut's Tomb Is The Biggest Discovery Of All
Time""

We could zoom out and make it more easily understandable and
broadly appealing:

""This Ancient Egyptian Tomb Is The Biggest Discovery Of All Time""

Or we could try to add more curiosity:

""This Ancient Egyptian Tomb Changes Everything We Know About
History""

Why this works:

Negativity - ""the death of"" brings conflict and controversy,
which people love.

Confirms Suspicions - Because of celebrities, influencers, and
social media, trends are more prevalent and fast-moving. Many
people already kinda feel like personal style is dying (or at
least changing), so this video latches onto that feeling.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the
death of something that's changing or struggling.

bad it turned out.

How you can use this framework: Try a poorly-rated thing in your
niche.

Examples of this framework in action:

* I Hired a 1-Star Stylist
* I Tried a 1-Star Restaurant

Title: You’re Not Behind: Why Everyone SEEMS To Have More Money

): +738

Why this works:

Negativity - This is all about a pain point: feeling like
everyone has more money than you.

Status - This is also about your status and how wealthy you are
compared to everyone else.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience that they're
not in an unwanted state and why everyone SEEMS to be in a better
situation than them.

Examples of this framework in action:

* You’re Not Messy: Why Everyone SEEMS To Be More Organized Than
You
* You’re Not Awkward: Why Everyone SEEMS To Be More Charismatic
Than You

): +2072

Why this works:

Specific Audience - If you identify as creative, but lazy (which
is a lot of us), this title makes you feel like this video was
made specifically for you, so you're more likely to watch it.

Negativity - Most people don't want to be lazy, so this calls out
a pain point and grabs your attention.

Curiosity - This title is a cliffhanger. You know who it's for
and what problem it addresses, but nothing else, which piques
your curiosity.

How you can use this framework: Call out a very specific audience
with a specific problem and tell them to watch your video.

Examples of this framework in action:

* If You’re Ambitious But Lazy Please Watch This
* If You Want to Eat Healthy But Crave Junk Food, Please Watch
This

Title: WARNING: AI Is Stealing People's Homes

Hook score: -83

Why this flopped: I really like the way this title is written, so
why did it flop?

My guess is that it's not very believable.

I'm writing this on my couch and having a really hard time
imagining AI busting down my door and stealing my home from me.

My house is just too tangible and I don't think it's going
anywhere (although Hurricane Milton tried last year).

I'm not saying the content in the video isn't true, I'm saying
just by reading the title I have a hard time imagining it to be.

Now if this was about AI stealing my identity, bank account, or
even people's teslas out of their driveways, that'd be more
believable because you can easily envision that happening.

So the next time you're deciding whether or not to make a video
ask yourself: is this topic believable? Can people imagine how it
would happen?

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

P.S. If you want to save more time and use a title generator that
uses all the titles from this newsletter, check out ​Creator

Title: 15 Signs Your Pregnancy Is Going Well in The First
Trimester

the beginning)

): +913

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Desire - Pregnant women would love to see signs their pregnancy
is going well.

New - This one might be a bit of a stretch, but in the first
trimester pregnancy is new, exciting, and nerve-wracking, so it's
calling out a specific audience. Plus, later in pregnancy,
there's often a clear sign the baby is doing well that you don't
have in the first trimester: the baby kicking.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the
signs a new thing is going well.

Why this works:

Curiosity & Desire - Everybody wants to know what the future
holds, but nobody actually knows, so the future is such a great
topic because it's full of curiosity and desire.

Timeliness - This video was published at the end of 2024 when
2025 was on everybody's mind.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the
future of your industry and current trends they need to know.

Why this works:

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you want to know what

Negativity - This has lots of drama and conspiracy, which people

authority figure they trust is skipping something, they should
run.

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience would love to easily draw every
day.

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you want to know what the
""one trick"" is.

Daily - There's something about doing an activity every day
that's exciting. It's tangible and aspirational, so talking about
doing things every day can be great to use in titles.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about one
trick to do something they want to do, but is sometimes difficult
to stick with, every day with ease.

Why this works:

Curiosity - This is counterintuitive. How can studying less give
you an advantage?

Desire - This leverages desire in two ways:

* Everybody would love to study less.
* Everybody wants an unfair advantage.

Title: A Mother Forgives and ""ADOPTS"" Her Son's MURDERER... (True
Story)

Hook score: -95

Why this flopped: Here are some of the most-viewed titles on this
channel:

* If You Hear a Pastor SKIP This Verse... RUN!! (Here's What They
Are Hiding)
* They ""REMOVED"" This Verse From The Bible!! (WHY??)
* Pastors Want This Video BANNED!! (You'll See Why)​

Two things are clear from these titles:

* The videos are about Christianity
* The videos are educational

This title doesn't meet either of those criteria.

It's a story and doesn't say anything about Christianity, which
is probably a big part of why it didn't get as many views as most
of the other videos on this channel.

Two things he could do:

First, make it clear that this video is about a Christian to
attract the right audience:

""Christian Woman Forgives and ""ADOPTS"" Her Son's MURDERER...
(True Story)""

(Note that we're using a keyword not to let the algorithm know
what this video is about, but to let the audience know.)

The other option is to spin it in an educational way:

""The Bible Verse That Let This Woman Forgive and ""ADOPT"" Her
Son's MURDERER""

To avoid a flop like this on your channel, know why people watch
your channel and deliver on that premise in each video.

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

P.S. If you want to save more time and use a title generator that
uses all the titles from this newsletter, check out ​Creator

Title: Psychoanalyst's Advice For Young Parents | Erica Komisar

Framework: (Authority Figure’s) Advice For (Noobs)

​Hook score (
https://click.convertkit-mail.com/gku790x74xi5hl78z56urh8nq6e99bm/wnh2hghwd9lomxb7/aHR0cHM6Ly9jcmVhdG9yaG9va3MuY29tL2hvb2stc2NvcmUtZXhwbGFpbmVkLw==
): +301

Why this works:

Authority - ""Psychoanalyst"" brings authority and credibility to
this title.

Beginners - Calling out beginners, or, in this case, ""Young
Parents,"" is great for grabbing attention because they're the
most eager to learn.

Desire - Young or new parents often appreciate the advice of an
authority figure.

How you can use this framework: Share the advice of an authority
figure for beginners or new people in your niche.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Physical Therapist's Advice For New Runners

): +645

Why this works:

Negativity - This is all about stopping an accidental problem.

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you want to know what
""this"" is.

Desire - This creator's audience would love to stop killing their
aloe vera.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience how to stop
accidentally doing something once they learn ""this"".

): +795

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Status - This is about status: are you a winner or loser?

Timeliness - This video was published at the end of 2024 when
2025 was on everybody's mind.

Desire - This creator's audience loves AI and wants to get better
at using it.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the
skills that will separate the winners from the losers this year.

): +1478

Why this works:

Curiosity - This title does a great job of starting a story to
grab your attention. It's a cliffhanger that uses tension and
almost forces you to click because you've got to see what
happens.

Negativity - ""Psychopathic Stalker"" and ""Wrong Judge"" bring some
drama and conflict to get you interested in this video.

How you can use this framework: Use a cliffhanger to build
tension around a story involving dramatic characters.

Why this works:

Negativity - ""doomscrolling"" is a problem that many people in
this audience resonate with.

Desire - This creator's audience would love to stop doomscrolling
by using something more wholesome, like this notebook.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about a simple
product that fixes or replaces a problem.

)
Title: Judge DiSanto Calls This Court Case Her “Daily Disaster”

Hook score: -92

Why this flopped: People make this mistake all the time: using
proper names at the wrong time.

Unless the person's name is a household name, like Elon Musk or
LeBron James, it's often better to use their position, like
judge, NBA player, etc.

This is because if people don't immediately recognize the name,
that may cause them to not be interested in the video. On the
other hand, everybody will immediately recognize ""judge.""

On top of that, it seems like the audience isn't really into this
angle.

Here are a few other angles:

""This Court Case Ruined This Judge's Life""

This adds a bit more drama and may be too hyperbolic, but people
do love drama.

""Drunk Defendant Accidentally Makes His Case A Lot Worse""

Again adding more drama here, but it's also a bit more
interesting because it gives more detail about the defendant, as
opposed to the vague, ""daily disaster"".

If your initial angle isn't working, switch it up and try
something new, don't just make tiny little changes.

Why this works:

Negativity - Telling someone to stop doing something they think
is good or is common is a great way to grab their attention.

Curiosity - This is counterintuitive because many people in this
creator's audience think the goal of Christianity is to go to
Heaven. The thumbnail text also challenges that assumption.

): +1868

Why this works:

Negativity - This isn't about the best tech of 2024. It's about
tech that died, and people love drama like this.

Timeliness - This video was published at the end of 2024, so it's
relevant right now.

Curiosity - This makes you wonder what this tech is.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the
things that died in the year that just ended.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Interior Design Trends that Died in 2024
* Jobs that Died in 2024

Title: It’s Time To Take Your Dreams Seriously - The Alchemist by
Paulo Coelho

Hook score: -88

Why this flopped: This title isn't punchy or tangible enough.
""It’s Time To Take Your Dreams Seriously"" is just a little too
fluffy.

Here are some of the other titles she tried:

* It's Time To Take Your Dreams Seriously
* Dreams Showdown: Following Your Heart vs Playing It Safe
* Take your dreams seriously before it's too late.

These are all about a similar angle: taking your dreams
seriously.

If your video isn't doing as well as you hoped, it's often best
to totally switch up the angle.

Here are some options:

""Quit Putting Your Dreams On Pause""

Similar message, but it's a warning that brings a bit more drama.

""Stop Letting Life Pass You By""

Similar to the ""quit"" title above, but this is a slightly
different way to tap into the audience's biggest fears and
frustrations.

""Read This Book To Make 2025 Your Best Year Ever""

New angle that talks about the benefits of this book and brings
some timeliness into it.

Lesson: if a video didn't do well, come up with titles from new
angles that bring more curiosity, fear, or desire.

Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

): +346

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Desire - This creator's audience wants to learn about delicious
sauces.

Curiosity - The way this is written opens a loop and makes you
wonder what these sauces are.

""Every"" - The word ""every"" makes this list feel more epic,
interesting, and relevant for, well, every chef.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the
things everyone in your niche needs to do.

Why this works:

Authority - This video has credibility because it's about what
the legendary guitarists did.

Many people overcomplicate their titles and thumbnails.

Here's an example where simplifying your title to make it more
punchy and emotional and focusing on attracting a single group
(only freelancers — not freelancers and SMBs), improved the CTR.

): +335

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Desire - This creator's audience wants to plant veggies now. But
they might be thinking winter is not a good time to plant
veggies, so this topic is even more exciting.

Timeliness - This video was published at the end of November and
is all about what to do right now.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about things
they can do this month right now.

Why this works:

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you wonder what ""This""
is.

Negativity - Calling out ADHD and saying it's a curse grabs
people's attention.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience that something
they struggle with is a bad or a curse until they learn ""this"".

Why this works:

Negativity - Nobody wants to be cheated on, so this leverages
fear, pain, and insecurity to grab your attention and get you to
click.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the
types of something that always do something negative.

Title: 6 things your (introvert) woman needs you to understand
about dating her

Hook score: -82

Why this flopped: The most successful videos on this channel are
about benefits or fears for the audience:

* ""These types of women ALWAYS cheat on their men"" 329K views
* ""How to turn any woman on (without touching her)"" 294K views
* ""Giving her distance is your superpower"" 120K views

""6 things your (introvert) woman needs you to understand about
dating her"" is kind of about the audience, but more about their
woman. And although the audience cares about their woman, they
care about themselves more.

Not to mention, the fact that this is about dating introverted
women narrows the audience a bit (which isn't necessarily bad),
but the audience needs to think for a second — is my woman an
introvert?

If I were to rewrite this title, I'd try to make it more about
the audience:

""If You're Dating An Introvert You Need To Know THIS""

or

""6 Things You NEED To Know If You're Dating An Introvert""

Why this works:

Curiosity - This builds curiosity 3 ways:

* It's about the future and the future is a naturally
curiosity-filled topic.
* It's secretive and makes you want to know what's going to
happen.
* It finishes with a question.

Negativity - This title hints at fear and doom and people love to
consume that content.

Timeliness - This is about a current event, which almost adds
some urgency to this title.

): +695

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience would love to afford a Porsche,
and the fact that they'll go up in value adds to that desire.

Large Potential Audience - Since this is about the ""cheapest""
Porsches, it attracts a large potential audience.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about cheap
versions of things that are normally too expensive for them.

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

cheap-looking kitchen, so people have to click on this video to
avoid those things.

Title: How To Clean Your Engine Bay For CHEAP!

Hook score: -87

Why this flopped: I don't know about you, but I've never thought,
""Oh, I can't wait to learn about how to clean my engine bay!""

Now this could be an SEO play and this video may get lots of
views over time.

But also, sometimes you have to make a video about an unsexy
topic.

Maybe a sponsor requested it, a small part of your core audience
begs for it, or it promotes a product you sell.

So let's brainstorm ways to make this title more clickable.

We could make it more tangible, yet still add curiosity:

""The $10 Cleaning Hack Every Car Lover Needs To Do""

We could add some FOMO:

""The Most Powerful Car Cleaning Step You're Probably Not Doing""

Or, if we're sticking with the SEO game plan, we could be a
little more specific about the benefits of this video:

""How To Clean Your Engine Bay For $10 In 10 Minutes""

12/4/2024 12:23:47,How to brainstorm video ideas in Creator Hooks Pro,"Hey Ian,

This email is for my YouTube nerds who like to get into the weeds
and really get their wheels spinning about YouTube titles, ideas,
and thumbnails.

Creator Hooks Pro has a database of","Hey Ian,

This email is for my YouTube nerds who like to get into the weeds
and really get their wheels spinning about YouTube titles, ideas,
and thumbnails.

Creator Hooks Pro has a database of over 1,000 hand-picked viral
videos.

One of my favorite ways to get my brain in the mode of coming up
with good titles and ideas is to scroll through the database, see
what’s worked for other channels, and see how I can use those
strategies for my own channel.

But to find titles that are specifically related to what you’re
looking for, we’ve got filters for you.

Here’s what they are and how to use them:

​
Click Triggers

This filter is for when you have an idea for an emotion or angle
in a title, but you want to see how others have successfully used
it in their titles.

For example, if you want to see how others have used curiosity,
you would filter by the curiosity click trigger and then get 100s
of examples of how to build curiosity.

Channel Type

If you want to narrow things down a bit and only see videos from
channels that create the same type of content as you, such as
talking head, faceless, or vlog channels, this filter is for you.

The channel type and video type are my two favorite filters if
I’m just looking to browse and don’t really know what my idea or
title is.

Niche

Most people’s first reaction is to use the niche filter, but I
recommend against that. The cool thing about the database is that
it lets you easily see successful videos from a variety of
niches, and lets you bring things that are working in other
niches over to yours.

That being said, filtering by your niche can help you find good
topics and see what's working for similar channels.

Video Type

If you know what type of video you’re making, such as a review,
list, or interview, this filter is perfect. It shows you exactly
how successful creators on YouTube have packaged this type of
video, so the results are highly relevant.

Search

The best way to use the search function is to search for broad
words, like “mistake,” “secret,” or “top 10” to see how others
have used the angle you're considering. Searching for
niche-specific words is hit or miss with the database.

If you want specific words related to your niche, I’d use the
generator to generate titles using those words.

And here’s one last tip to get the most out of the generator:

If you spend a lot of time browsing it and using the same filters
over and over, you’ll eventually start to see the same titles. To
prevent this, go to the sort by dropdown on the top right and
select “Random.” This will help you discover new titles and keep
the ideas flowing.

You can view the database here:

12/3/2024 12:22:48,the secret to getting more views with Creator Hooks Pro,"Hey Ian,

Here's how people get the most views with Creator Hooks Pro:

Here's how people get the most views with Creator Hooks Pro:

They don’t just generate one set of titles, copy one, and then go
on their merry way.

They:

* Generate a handful of titles
* See which ones they like best
* Mix and match different words and phrases
* Come up with the perfect title for their video

Here are 3 easy steps so you can do that, too:

Step 1: Generate titles

Write 3-10 words describing your video in the description box and
generate titles.

​
Step 2: Save your favorites

When you see a title you like, even if you only like a phrase or
a word in it, click the bookmark icon to the left of the title.

This will open up your folders in the right sidebar. Create a
folder for the video you're working on so you can save all your
potential titles in one place.

​
Step 3: Repeat

Generate a few more sets of titles and save 10 or more of your
favorites.

Then look through your list, see which titles or phrases you like
best, and decide on the perfect title for your video.

Bonus Tip: Use the unused titles

All of those titles you didn’t use are perfect for:

* Thumbnail text angles
* Intro inspiration
* Subtopics within your video
* Ideas for your next video

And since you’ve saved them all to a folder, you can easily come
back whenever you want and get your wheels spinning again.

Click the “Favorites” tab on the left sidebar or the bookmark
icon at the top right to view your folders.

The title generator is our most popular feature, but the biggest
question people have about it is, ""What do I put in the
description box about my video?”

Here's a simple answer: describe what your video is about in 2-10
words.

This isn't ChatGPT where giving more information will help it
write a better title.

Great YouTube titles have a singular focus, so if you want the
title generator to write good titles for you, it works best if
you tell it what to focus on.

But if at first it doesn’t give you titles you like, you can
generate different titles by:

* Shortening up your description and being more broad (e.g.
""YouTube tips"").
* Making it a little longer and being more specific (e.g.
""YouTube tips for busy business owners who don't like being on
camera"").

Many people try too hard when trying to build curiosity in their
titles.

They use too many words and exclamation marks when in reality
they're often better off using simpler, but more emotional
titles.

In this example, we swapped out a cliche (""hidden in plain
sight"") with some FOMO (""Most Tourists Miss"").

We also simplified it by removing the word ""Curious"" in the
beginning of the title, which made it a little easier to read.

12/1/2024 14:07:38,The #1 Tip To Create Better Video Ideas,"The best way to come up with video ideas is to remake your proven

topics from dozens of different angles.

When I managed a fishing channel at my last job, ""trout lures""
was one of our most successful topics.

Every week we would make a video about trout lures:

* 10 Mistakes You're Making With Trout Lures
* The ONLY Trout Lure You Need This Fall
* The #1 Rule For Throwing Trout Lures
* I Wish I Tried This Lure Sooner…

We had 5-10 topics we cycled through and it worked really well
for us (we went from about 70K subscribers when I started to
200K+ subscribers by the time I left).

But this process was slow, manual work.

That’s why I built this automatically into Creator Hooks Pro.

The generator stores your proven topics so with just one click
you can start generating video ideas.

Here's an example of what it might look like for a finance
channel:

It’s","Howdy!

When I go to write titles, I struggle with two things:

* It's hard to get started and beat ""blank page"" syndrome.
* Once I do get started, I use my same go-to formats every time.

It’s tough to get out of my normal way of thinking and actually
think outside the box about new, better, spicier ways to write my
titles.

Do you struggle with that, too?

The best way to beat this is to read through a list of proven
titles. It’s kinda like a warm-up for your brain.

I used to do it by reading through a Google sheet with all of my
favorite titles.

You could also create a playlist of titles you see on YouTube
that you like.

But now in the Creator Hooks Pro title generator, you can put in
your video’s topic and quickly see dozens of ways you could write
your title.

Plus, you’ll see the original title and thumbnail that inspired
our suggestion, so you can think about the whole package:

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

P.S. If you want to save more time and use a title generator that
uses all the titles from this newsletter, check out Creator Hooks

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience loves cameras.

Curiosity - This builds curiosity two ways:

* This opens a loop and makes you wonder what the camera is and
why you need it.
* ""ONLY"" adds a constraint which makes this more interesting.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the only
thing they'll ever need.

): +780

Why this works:

Curiosity - This title opens two loops:

* ""This Supplement"" is open-ended and makes you want to know what
the supplement is.
* ""Changing"" is also open-ended. What's changing about it?

Negativity - There's a hint of controversy here since typically
people don't like supplements changing their sport, and the
thumbnail text in red supports the thought that this is a
negative change.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience that something
is changing your industry, but build curiosity by not specifying
exactly what it is or how it's changing it.

Why this works:

Epic - Describing a tennis match as turning into ""WAR"" makes this
feel way more epic and exciting.

Negativity - This title brings a lot of conflict, which people
love.

Authority - Federer and Medvedev grab attention here because
they're both popular tennis players.

something turning into WAR.

Calling out beginners in your title is one of the easiest ways to
get more views.

Beginners are the biggest, hungriest, most eager-to-learn part of
any audience.

And when you make them feel like your video was made just for
them, they're more likely to click.

You can call out beginners two ways:

* You can be obvious and use the word ""beginners"".
* You can imply your video is for beginners, like how title B
used the words, ""Your First"".

Why this works:

Negativity - This title is full of drama, which grabs the
audience's attention and interest.

Curiosity - The title opens a loop and makes you wonder what the
stunt was, but the thumbnail probably deserves most of the credit
here.

The thumbnail builds so much curiosity because it shows the
moment right before something dramatic happens.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about a
specific thing or event that ended something. Bonus points if
your thumbnail shows the tense moment right before that thing
happens.

* The Mistake That Ended The Roman Empire

): +423

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience would love to go from $0 to $1M
in 12 months.

Beginners - ""Going From $0"" insinuates this video is for
beginners, which attracts the biggest, hungriest group in any
audience.

Time Frame - The time frame of ""in 12 months"" makes this video
more tangible and interesting. Plus, since it's relatively short,
it increases desire, too.

Curiosity - This ends by opening a loop and making you want to
know what he'd do.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience what you'd do
if you wanted to start from scratch and reach a big milestone in
a short period of time.

Examples of this framework in action:

* If I Wanted to Go From Microwave Meals to Master Chef in 8

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Negativity - This is all about drama, which people love.

Curiosity - ""and is Hiding it"" makes you feel like there's some
secrecy going on.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about 7 signs
something bad and secretive is going on.

): +2400

Why this works:

Negativity - This video warning viewers about turning settings
off has 3.4M views, while the video about turning settings on
from the same channel only has 471K views. Turning settings off
brings fear of what might happen if you don't turn them off,
instead of turning them on and thinking about the benefits you'd
get from them.

Curiosity - This title is vague and open-ended, which builds
curiosity about what the settings are and what could happen if
you don't turn them off.

Timeliness - iOS 18.1 was just released, so people are thinking

Title: This Stupid TRICK Helped Me Play In Every Key On Guitar

Framework: This Stupid TRICK Helped Me (Achieve Goal)

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience would love to be able to play
every key on guitar. And note that this isn't just about getting
better at guitar. It's a specific desire, and the word ""Every""
gives it an almost epic feeling.

Curiosity - This builds curiosity in two ways:

* It opens a loop and makes you want to know what the trick is.
* It's counterintuitive that a ""stupid"" trick would help you do
something awesome.

Negativity - This isn't about a cool trick, it's about a ""stupid""
trick, which grabs attention.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about a stupid
trick that helps them do something awesome.

Examples of this framework in action:

* This Stupid TRICK Helps Me Be More Productive Every Day
* This Simple TRICK Helps Me Sleep Well Every Night

Title: 27 Years of No Bullsh*t Sales Advice in 16 Mins

Hook score: -90

Why this flopped: This title format is trending right now, so why
did it flop?

Well, the not-fun answer is sometimes videos flop for a variety
of complicated reasons and it's hard to identify exactly what
went wrong.

But we don't do not-fun answers here.

This section is to brainstorm ways we'd improve the packaging, so
let's do it.

One of my go-to moves in titles and thumbnails is to challenge
assumptions.

In this case, instead of ""This Sh*t Is So Easy"" in the thumbnail,
I'd use challenge common sales assumptions by saying something
like ""Stop Following Up"" or ""Stop Using A Script"".

You could also build curiosity with something like, ""I Wish I
Knew This...""

Regarding the title, we could try to simplify it by shortening it
to, ""27 Years of Sales Advice in 16 Mins"".

If the topic and/or thumbnail are both great, you often don't
need a fancy title to get people to click.

Or we could change the angle and make it more specific by trying
something like, ""Everything You Need To Know About Selling
Software In 2025"".

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Negativity - ""Scams"" brings drama and controversy that grabs the
audience's attention and makes them click.

Epic & Extreme - ""Biggest"" and ""In Gaming History"" makes this
video feel epic and extreme.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the
biggest scams in your niche's history.

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience would love to get 50,000
followers in 1 month. Plus, ""9 Easy Steps"" adds to the desire by
making it sound easy.

Time Frame - The short time frame of ""In 1 Month"" also adds to
the desire and makes this video feel more tangible and
interesting.

Credibility - This isn't just a ""how to"" video, this is a ""how I""
video, which makes it feel more credible.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience how you
achieved a big goal of theirs in a relatively short time frame,
and give them easy steps so they can do the same.

The best way to write YouTube titles is to model other proven
titles.

And we just updated Creator Hooks Pro’s title generator so you
can now see the inspiration for the titles we’re generating to
make this even easier for you.

(You can see what it looks like in the “inspiration” popup in the
image above).

This is part of our mission to help you write better titles, save
time, and grow your channel.

Why this works:

Curiosity - This builds curiosity because it's counterintuitive
that something seemingly meaningless, like an ancient Roman
shipwreck, can do something so meaningful, like explain the
universe.

Epic - Explaining the entire universe is pretty epic.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience how something
meaningless or obscure can explain something so important.

): +3399

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Desire & Negativity - This covers both ends of the spectrum with
nuts you should and shouldn't eat.

Curiosity - These two lists of nuts you should and shouldn't eat
do a great job of building curiosity because you've gotta click
to find out what the nuts are.

Note: I typically don't like using the word ""and"" in titles
because it dilutes the focus, but here's a great example of that
being a preference, not a rule.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about a list
of things they should and shouldn't be doing.

Examples of this framework in action:

* 4 Countries You Have To Visit And 4 That Are Overrated
* 4 LA Neighborhoods You Should Consider Moving To And 4 You

Why this works:

Negativity - This controversial topic does a great job of
grabbing the audience's attention.

Curiosity - This question builds curiosity, and ""WHAT'S REALLY

How you can use this framework: Ask why something bad and/or
dramatic is happening.

Title: A Scientist's Guide To Composting

Hook score: -75

Why this flopped: There are probably a few reasons that
contributed to this video flopping:

* It's not dramatic enough. Many of the best titles from this
channel have some drama, like ""An Ancient Roman Shipwreck May
Explain the Universe"" (4.5M views) or ""The Doorway to the
Underworld is Growing and We Can't Stop It"" (2.5M views).

* There's not much curiosity.
* The audience might not be looking for a guide to composting
from this channel.

We can't really change #1 — the video just doesn't have that much
drama.

And we can't change #3 — the video is already posted and the
audience wants what they want.

But we can change #2. Let's try to add some curiosity to this
title:

""How Your Trash Can Make The Planet Healthier""

""Stop Throwing Away Your Kitchen Trash - Do This Instead""

We can also try to increase the desire by making it more tangible
or calling out beginners:

""3 Steps To Make Perfect Compost In 60 Days""

""Everything You Need To Know To Start Composting As A Beginner""

Title: 43 minutes straight of SOLID communication skills advice

): +456

Why this works:

Time Frame - The time frame of ""43 minutes"" makes this video more
tangible and interesting.

Desire - This creator's audience wants to get better at
communication skills.

How you can use this framework: This is a great example of how to
package a compilation video. Put several videos together about a
topic your audience wants to learn about and say it's X minutes
straight of solid advice on that topic.

Examples of this framework in action:

* 47 minutes straight of SOLID sales advice
* 53 minutes straight of AMAZING gardening advice

): +800

Why this works:

Timeliness - This video was published 9 days before Halloween.

Negativity - This title could've been, ""The History of
Halloween,"" but adding some fear and controversy with
""Frightening Pagan"" makes this title way more interesting.

Hint: if you're reading this now, you may want to consider doing
a similar video for the next few holidays coming up.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the
frightening (or other similar ) history of a trending or current
event.

Examples of this framework in action:

* The Controversial Bloody History of Thanksgiving
* The Insanely Weak History of New Year's Resolutions

): +812

Why this works:

Negativity - ""Rip-Offs"" are a controversial topic that do a great
job of grabbing the audience's attention.

Authority - This leverages the credibility of ""Experts"" to make
this video more desirable and interesting.

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you want to know what the
rip-offs are.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the
rip-offs experts never pay for in your niche.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Car Rip-Offs Experts NEVER Pay For During Oil Changes
* Restaurant Rip-Offs Experts NEVER Pay For at Dinner

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience would love to make money on
YouTube from Day 1.

Beginners - This attracts beginners, the biggest part of any
audience, because it's about ""Day 1"".

Refute Objection - A lot of people think it takes a lot of time
to make money on YouTube, but this title refutes that objection
and says you'll learn how to make money from day 1.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience how to achieve
a goal from day 1.

Why this works:

Credibility - This title is great because it shows she actually
did something interesting, instead of just sharing her thoughts
on something.

Curiosity - This does a great job at starting a story, but not
finishing it, so you've gotta click to find out how the designs
turned out.

How you can use this framework: Pay people on Fiverr (or another
platform) to do the same thing and then compare the results.

Examples of this framework in action:

* I paid 5 different photographers to take the same family
pictures
* I used 5 AI writers to write a sales page for the same product

Title: Large Cruise Ships vs Small Cruise Ships - Which is
Better?

Hook score: -95

Why this flopped: Apparently people don't care too much about
this topic (although it could get decent search traffic long
term).

So what can we do? We can't change the intro or the content, but
we can try to change the angle of the title and how we position
the video.

Instead of asking the audience a question, I'd make a bold
statement, add my polarizing opinion, and/or build some
curiosity:

""The WORST Thing About Large Cruise Ships""

""Why I ONLY Book Small Cruise Ships""

""The #1 Difference Between Small & Large Cruise Ships Every
Cruiser Needs To Know""

""I Wish I Knew THIS Before Booking My Last Cruise""

Why this works:

Constraint - The constraint of making a movie in one shot makes
this video more challenging and interesting.

Curiosity - Asking if you can do something challenging is a
simple way to build curiosity.

How you can use this framework: Ask if you can do something
difficult in one try.

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience is into personal branding.

Curiosity - This builds curiosity two ways:

* It makes you wonder what the new approach is.
* ""Changes Everything"" is open-ended and makes you wonder what
will change.

New Opportunity - People love new opportunities like new
approaches because they offer hope.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the new
approach to something they're trying to do that changes
everything.

Why this works:

Conspiracy & Curiosity - ""The Media Won't Show You"" adds some
conspiracy and makes you feel like you're getting in on a secret.

And China is polarizing, which also grabs attention. If this was
""The Side of (Unheard of Country) The Media Won't Show You,""
nobody would care.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the side
of a polarizing topic the media won't show them.

Examples of this framework in action:

* The Side of the NFL the Media Won't Show You
* The Side of Electric Cards Elon Musk Won't Admit

): +2881

Why this works:

Timeliness - This video was published a few weeks before the
election and does a great job of riding the election's popularity
(and polarity).

Authority - Since this creator is a tax expert, he has authority
regarding tax plans, so you want to hear what he has to say about
this topic.

Negativity - The thumbnail makes it clear there's some
controversy in this video.

How you can use this framework: If you're an expert or
professional, break down a trending authority's plan for
something in your realm.

Examples of this framework in action:

* PGA Coach Breaks Down Trump's Golf Swing
* Ex-Nasa Engineer Breaks Down Elon Musk's Space Plan

): +4072

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience wants to study fast.

Speed - Adding speed (in this case, ""study so FAST"") is a great
way to enhance your audience's desire and interest in your
video's topic.

Negativity - ""feels ILLEGAL"" adds a bit of controversy and an
edge to this video that makes it feel more exciting.

How you can use this framework: Show your audience how to do
something so fast that it feels illegal.

Examples of this framework in action:

* How to Get Jacked so FAST that it feels ILLEGAL😳
* How to Learn Guitar so FAST that it feels ILLEGAL

A/B Test of the Week

)
Suppose your video is about a topic people don't immediately
recognize or aren't necessarily excited about (even if it's cool
once they learn about it).

In that case, you might not want to include the exact topic in
your title.

Instead, you can zoom out and give it a simple, but extreme label
(like ""Ireland's Creepiest Island"").

This makes your title easier to understand and more exciting.

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you
write such great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you
write great titles and save time.

): +472

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience loves high-paying small business
ideas for women.

Curiosity - This title does a great job of getting you excited
about the idea, but not telling you what it is, so you have to
click and watch the video.

New - People love new things.

Specific Audience - If you're a woman, you feel like this video
was made for you, so you're way more likely to watch this video.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about a new
awesome thing specifically for them, but don't specify exactly
what it is in the title.

Examples of this framework in action:

* The NEW High Interest Savings Account JUST FOR PARENTS
* The NEW Driver Golf Swing Drill JUST FOR SENIORS

Why this works:

Curiosity - This is counterintuitive because most people think
weeds ARE the garden problems, not the answer to them.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience that something
they typically think is bad is the answer to their problems.

* Eating More Food Is the Answer to Your Weight Loss Problems!

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience would love for their kids to
ditch the toys.

Time Frame - ""30-MIN"" makes this method sound more tangible,
achievable, and interesting.

Curiosity - You know what this method does and how long it takes,
but you don't know anything about how to execute it, so you've
gotta click and find out.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about a short
method to help them achieve a goal or ditch something they're
trying to ditch.

Examples of this framework in action:

* The 30-SECOND METHOD to ditch 99% of your anxiety
* The 10-MIN METHOD to stop 90% of work meetings

Why this works:

Time Frame - ""7-Day"" makes this challenge sound more tangible,
achievable, and interesting.

Desire - Most people would love to change their life.

Curiosity - This title is vague, but interesting. The time frame
and ""change my life"" both make this challenge sound interesting,
but you have no other details besides those two, so you've gotta
click to learn more.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about a 7-day
(or similar time frame) challenge that changed your life.

Examples of this framework in action:

Title: What the Forest Taught Me About Gardening

Hook score: -77

Why this flopped: This title is a little bland and boring.

The video is about lazy gardening (aka gardening without watering
or weeding), and here are some of the previous titles she tried
(thanks, Viewstats Chrome extension):

* The Ultimate Lazy Garden, and What It Has to Teach Us
* Lazy Gardening on Steroids: 7 Lessons From the Forest
* The World's Laziest Garden, and What It Has to Teach Us
* The World's Laziest Garden (The Forest), and What It Has to
Teach Us
* The World's Laziest Garden! | FULL Backyard Forest Tour!
* The World's Laziest Garden! | Backyard Forest Tour!
* What the Forest Has to Teach Us About Gardening

It seems like she really only tried two angles: lazy gardening
and what the forest teaches us about gardening.

Here are a few ways we could mix it up:

We could specifically call out the main benefit of lazy
gardening:

""The Secret To Having A Garden You Don't Need To Water Or Weed""

We could zoom out, be a little vague, and just hint at a big
benefit:

""This Gardening Secret Changed My Life Forever""

Or we could add a hint of regret:

""I Wish I Knew THIS About Gardening 10 Years Ago""

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Negativity - Nobody wants to make mistakes, which makes them a
great video topic.

Specific Audience - If you're a self-taught drummer, you feel
like this video was made specifically for you, so you're more
likely to click.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the 5
huge mistakes self-taught people make.

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Desire - This creator's audience would love to get rich all of a
sudden. But instead of this being a realistic scenario for most
people, it's probably more of an entertaining potential dream
scenario.

Title: 15 Strategies For Thriving When Stocks Drop

Hook score: -89

Why this flopped: This video's idea is actually pretty good –
what to do when the stock market is falling – but the title
doesn't clearly convey that.

""Strategies for Thriving"" is too wordy, complicated, and unclear.

Here are some some ways we could rewrite this:

""15 Investing Tips For When Stocks Drop""

""Do THIS When The Stock Market Crashes""

""This Is What Billionaires Do When Stocks Drop""

To avoid this mistake, make sure you're using clear, simple words
in your title.

): +419

Why this works:

Authority - “Pro Chefs” bring authority and credibility here. You
want to know what the pros have to say about these frozen
dumplings, which makes this video more interesting.

Credibility - A blind taste test makes this video feel more
credible, organic, and real.

Curiosity - There’s contrast between “Pro Chefs” and “Frozen
Dumplings”, which builds curiosity and makes this video more
interesting.

""Every"" - The word “Every” brings a feeling of epicness and
completeness to this video. They didn’t just test a few boxes,
they tested “Every”.

How you can use this framework: Get professionals to do an
unbiased test on cheap or unprofessional things in your niche.

Examples of this framework in action:

* College Professors Grade Real Student vs. AI Papers
* Pro Runners Blind Test Every Running Shoe Brand

): +460

Why this works:

Curiosity - This builds curiosity two ways:

* There’s a bit of contrast between “smallest” and “full frame”.
* It makes you want to know what camera this is.

Extreme - “Smallest” and “You’ve Ever Seen” both make this title
extreme and unique.

Desire - This creator’s audience likes small full frame cameras.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about an
extreme, unique, counterintuitive product they’d be interested
in.

Examples of this framework in action:

* The Loudest Silent Disco In The World
* The Biggest Miniature Dog Is The Perfect Pet

A Simple Way To Get More Views

ebook.

You'll see:

* The original title

* The before and after CTR
* And why the results turned out the way they did

Here's a sample page:

): +511

Why this works:

Negativity - “Red Flags” does a great job at grabbing attention.
Nobody wants to do these common behaviors and accidentally get in
trouble.

Curiosity - This builds curiosity two ways:

* It’s counterintuitive that “common behaviors” would be “major
red flags”.
* This does a good job of opening a loop and making you wonder
what these common behaviors are.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about common
things that are major red flags.

Examples of this framework in action:

* These Common Behaviors Are MAJOR Dating Red Flags
* These Popular Trends Are MAJOR Recession Red Flags

): +1073

Why this works:

Trending - Tesla Cybertrucks are still trending right now, which
brings a lot of attention to this title.

Negativity - “It Scares the Crap Out of Me” brings some fear
here.

Curiosity - “It Scares the Crap Out of Me” also builds curiosity
because it’s so vague and makes you want to know why it scares
him so much.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience that you
finally got a trending product, but it scares the crap out of
you.

Examples of this framework in action:

* I Finally Got Apple Vision Pro and It Scares the Crap Out of Me
* I Just Tried ChatGPT’s Newest Model and It Scares the Crap Out
of Me

Title: Turn a Handkerchief Into a Spectacular Gift in 10 Minutes

Framework: Turn a (Mundane Object) Into a (Amazing, Different
Object) in (Short Time Frame)

): +3271

Why this works:

Desire - This creator’s audience loves to turn regular things in
spectacular things.

Time Frame - The short time frame of “in 10 minutes” adds to that
desire because it makes it feel tangible and accomplishable.

Curiosity - The contrast between “handkerchief” and “spectacular
gift” builds curiosity and interest.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience how they can
turn something mundane into something spectacular in a short
period of time.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Turn a Blog Post Into a Viral Video in 10 Minutes
* Turn Leftovers Into a Spectacular Meal in 10 Minutes

Title: These 3 Dressings Will Upgrade Any Salad | Epicurious 101

Hook score: -77

Why this flopped: This title isn't bad. It's straightforward and
benefit-driven, but apparently not spicy enough (this video got
67K views, but the channel averages about 257K).

Here are a few ways we could mix it up:

We could add a constraint:

""The Only 3 Salad Dressings You Need""

We could try to hype it up more:

""These 3 Salad Dressings Will Change Your Life""

Or we could make it a bit more tangible and add an even crazier
benefit:

""3 Home-Made Salad Dressings To Make Him Fall In Love With You""

Of course, there's always the fact that this audience just might
not be into salad dressings, but that's whole different topic.

Title: I think I found the new KING of Budget Home Gym Equipment!

): +439

Why this works:

Epic - This is a creative, epic way to say you found a great
product.

Curiosity - This builds curiosity because it makes you want to
know more about the product and what it is.

Desire - This leverages desire two ways:

* This creator's audience loves home gym equipment.
* ""Budget"" increases the desire because it sounds more
affordable.

""Budget"" also attracts a large audience because it's about
affordable equipment. If the video was about a $10,000 product,
this topic would have a lot less of a potential audience.

Note: the company that owns this product is spending a lot of
money on advertising. This is a popular product that many people
are probably wondering about, which probably also contributed to
the higher views. How do I know this? Their Instagram ads got me.
I bought it and I love it.

How you can use this framework: Review a cool, popular product
and call it the new KING (or QUEEN) of its category.

Examples of this framework in action:

* I think I found the new KING of Budget Camping Tents
* I think I found the new KING of Email Newsletter Platforms!

): +479

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience would love to keep their garages
comfy year-round. Plus, ""easy"" enhances the audience's desire for
these upgrades.

Curiosity - This does a great job at opening a loop because it
says there are two upgrades, but doesn't specify what they are,
so you've gotta click to find out.

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about two easy
upgrades that can help them achieve a goal.

Examples of this framework in action:

* These 2 Easy Upgrades Keep Your Guitar Sounding Amazing
* These 2 Easy Changes Make Your MacBook Air Faster

): +537

Why this works:

Desire - This title leverages desire two ways:

* This creator's audience wants mixing advice
* They're getting a lot in a little (10 years in just 10
minutes).

Credibility - Sharing how many years of experience you have (if
it's significant) does a great job at building credibility.

Time Frame - People love time frames, and this title has two of
them. ""10 Years"" builds credibility and ""10 minutes"" increases
the desire and lets you know exactly what you're getting in this
video.

How you can use this framework: Condense your many years of
experience into a short time frame for your audience.

Examples of this framework in action:

* 10 Years of Farming Experience in 10 Minutes
* 10 Years of Photography Advice in 10 Minutes

Why this works:

Credibility - This starts with a simple statement showing why
people should listen to him.

Specific Audience - If you're in your 20s, you feel like this
video was made specifically for you, so you're more likely to
watch.

How you can use this framework: State your experience and then
call out a specific audience you can help. Usually, this audience
is your past self when you were just getting started.

): +26750

Why this works:

Negativity - Regrets make great video topics because they're so
tangible and emotional. Nobody wants to have regrets.

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Credibility - Since these are regrets from elderly retirees who
have been where the audience is planning on going, these regrets
feel more credible.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the top
regrets of people who have achieved what your audience is trying
to achieve.

Title: Energy Coach Shares 3 Secrets to a Long and Happy Life

Hook score: -98

Why this flopped: This video makes two big mistakes:

* It's a different video format from the rest of the channel.
This is a clip from Sky News, not a talking head video like all
the other videos. I'd guess that as soon as people click on it
and see it's a news segment, they're clicking off the video.
* The title and thumbnail feel like they're coming from a news
channel. They feel stuffy and cheesy, whereas his other videos
(you can see the ""I'm 40"" video above as an example) feel more
natural and organic. The title isn't even that bad, but when
paired with that newsy screenshot for the thumbnail, it instantly
feels more sleazy.

To avoid a flop like this, make your thumbnails, titles, and
videos in a consistent format.

I'm assuming this creator wanted to build some authority by
showing he was on the news. If it were me and I wanted to do
this, I'd probably just mention it in a video that had the same
packaging and content style as my other videos, as opposed to
sharing the whole clip.

Title: Professional Engineer versus the FINAL LEVEL of Poly
Bridge 3…

Framework: (Authority Figure) versus (Game or Alternative
Challenge)…

​Hook score (
https://click.convertkit-mail.com/mvu2k852d5a5hglexk2fmhrqmdlqqa3/x0hph6hw64qz3vs5/aHR0cHM6Ly9jcmVhdG9yaG9va3MuY29tL2hvb2stc2NvcmUtZXhwbGFpbmVkLz9sY3RnPTJlem1vZTZv
): +462

Why this works:

Authority - This game is about building bridges, so how a
Professional Engineer plays it is interesting because they do
this in real life for a living.

Curiosity - X vs. Y videos like this build curiosity because
there's conflict and you want to know what will happen.

How you can use this framework: Show your audience how a
professional in a field compares to a game or something ""normal""
people do.

Examples of this framework in action:

* NBA Player versus NBA 2K Champion...
* Google Engineer versus ChatGPT Coding Challenge

): +470

Why this works:

Desire - This creator's audience would love to run fast at a low
heart rate. Plus, running at a low heart rate (Zone 2, for the
running nerds) is a hot trend right now.

Constraint - Running fast is easy, but the constraint of doing it
at a low heart rate makes it much more difficult. This increases
the desire and the intrigue of this video.

Curiosity - There's also a bit of counterintuitiveness here
because most people would assume if you're running fast you don't
have a low heart rate.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience how to achieve
a goal with a constraint or with little effort.

* How to Grow On LinkedIn By Publishing Less
* How to Visit The World's Most Beautiful Countries For Free

The best way to come up with YouTube video ideas is to see what
works for other channels and remix that idea for your channel.

Now you can do this automatically with the new Creator Hooks
Chrome extension!

): +609

Why this works:

Negativity - ""It's Illegal"" in the thumbnail does a great job at
grabbing attention and bringing the drama.

Curiosity - This title opens a loop and makes you wonder what
they found.

Credibility - This isn't just conjecture. Since they actually put
7 Uber drivers in a room it makes this video feel way more
believable.

How you can use this framework: Do an experiment with shocking
results and show your audience what you discovered.

Examples of this framework in action:

* We Asked ChatGPT What It Thinks About The Bible. What We Found
Will Shock You.
* 7 People Opened Their TikTok FYP. What We Found Will Shock You.

): +672

Why this works:

Curiosity - This is counterintuitive because most people would
assume the month you retire doesn't matter.

How you can use this framework: Make a counterintuitive statement
saying something matters more than most people think it does.

Examples of this framework in action:

* The Month You Buy A Car Really Matters
* The Time of Day You Work Out Really Matters

): +3541

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Specific Audience - Calling out seniors makes them feel like this
video was made for them, so they're way more likely to click.

Desire - This leverages desire two ways:

* Many seniors wish they could sleep better.
* ""Tonight"" adds to the desire because we all want our desires
asap.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about ways a
specific group of people can achieve a goal now.

Examples of this framework in action:

* 8 Ways for Students to Improve Their Memory In 5 Minutes
* 8 Ways Senior Golfers can Drive the Ball Farther Today

Title: Chicago Just Guaranteed Vacation Days for Everyone

Hook score: -96

Why this flopped: This title is too narrow. If you don't live in
Chicago, you probably don't care about this video.

It might have been better to skip this video because it's got
such a narrow audience, but since that ship has sailed, let's
take a crack at some other ways they could write this title.

""This Is The Best City In America For Working Class People""

""This American City Just Changed Work-Life Balance Forever""

""You Get Guaranteed Vacation Days If You Live In This City""

These titles add some curiosity and appeal to a larger audience.

Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

Title: 5 Habits That Instantly Boost Your Attractiveness

Framework: ​​5 Habits That Instantly (Achieve Goal)

​Hook score (
https://click.convertkit-mail.com/v8ukorlkzltrhxqk74lcghvlpo8llh9/6qheh8h7gr895gio/aHR0cHM6Ly9jcmVhdG9yaG9va3MuY29tL2hvb2stc2NvcmUtZXhwbGFpbmVkLz9sY3RnPTJlem1vZTZv
): +328

Why this works:

List - Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly
what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

Desire - This creator's audience would love to boost their
attractiveness. Plus, people love speed, so ""instantly"" adds to
this desire.

""Habits"" - Habits is a power word that works often in channels
that help people become better at something.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the 5
habits that help them instantly achieve a goal.

Examples of this framework in action:

* 5 Habits That Instantly Boost Your Productivity
* 5 Habits That Instantly Make Your Heart Healthier

): +615

Why this works:

Constraint - The constraint of ""One-Man-Show"" does two things
here:

* It builds curiosity. How can just one man make and deliver
NYC's hottest sandwiches?
* It increases desire and relatability. If this one man can do
it, maybe I can too?

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about an
entity with a constraint doing something impressive.

Examples of this framework in action:

* The One-Man-Band Making TikTok's Most Popular Music
* The One-Man-Agency Taking Over LA's Real Estate Market

Why this works:

Curiosity - ""Mysterious"" is a simple, but great way to build
curiosity.

extreme and epic, which makes it way more interesting.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the most

Why this works:

Authority - The French are known for being excellent dressers, so
this title leverages their authority.

Desire - This creator's audience wants to dress better and this
title essentially promises they will learn how to do that.

)
Title: Is AI Making The Dating World Harder to Date?

Hook score: -89

Why this flopped: There are two big problems with this title.

The first and biggest problem is that this channel's audience
doesn't seem to be interested in this topic.

In the last 5 months, this is the only video about AI.

(I do love trying out new topics to try to find new
opportunities, but sometimes it just doesn't work out!)

To avoid this problem, when you're evaluating potential ideas for
your channel one of the best questions to ask yourself is if it
has worked on your channel before.

The next problem is that it's a weak question.

Bold, confident, opinionated statements often work better as
YouTube titles than questions.

People are watching this channel to learn, and this question
doesn't really tell me I'm going to learn anything.

Plus, I already know the answer because it's a leading question
and because of the expressions in the thumbnail.

To avoid this problem, write your titles as bold, opinionated
statements.

Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

niches to yours. (For example, if you have an educational
channel, you’ll get good ideas from other educational channels,
but potentially not-so-good ideas from entertainment channels).
* If you see a title you like in the remixer, save it to your
favorites (

Title: I Sold My $100,000 Cybertruck After 50 Days

Framework: I Sold My (Expensive, Cool Object) After 50 Days

​Hook score (

): +392

Why this works:

Curiosity - This builds curiosity two ways:

* It opens a loop and makes you wonder why he sold his
Cybertruck.
* It’s a bit counterintuitive. Cyber trucks just got released,
they’re supposed to be cool, and he spent a lot of money on it…
why would he sell it?

Negativity - Selling a Cybertruck so early after buying it hints
at some drama and something wrong with it.

Time Frame - The short time frame of 50 days adds to the drama
here because it provides tangible proof he only kept this truck
for a short time, so something must have been off.

Timeliness - Cybertrucks are still trending a bit right now, so
this topic gets extra attention.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience why you sold
or moved on from something trending, expensive, desirable, and
exciting.

Examples of this framework in action:

* I Sold My $12,000 Mac Pro After 50 Days
* I Quit My $500,000 Google Engineering Job After 50 Days

Why this works:

Desire - This leverages desire 3 ways.

* This creator’s audience wants to make money online.
* They’re excited about side hustles.
* It’s about “lazy” side hustles. Laziness enhances the desire
because it makes it seem like it’s going to be easy.

I’ve seen “lazy” work several times on YouTube. I’ve also seen it
flop a few times, but I think it’s an interesting angle worth
exploring.

Timeliness - This leverages timeliness two ways:

* It uses in the current year.
* AI is still an exciting, trending topic.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the
laziest opportunities or ways to achieve a goal this year.

Examples of this framework in action:

* The Laziest Keto Recipes To Lose Weight In 2025
* The Laziest AI Hacks To Land Your Dream Job in 2025

): +461

Why this works:

Curiosity - There’s contrast here (unattractive vs. handsome) and
it opens a loop because you want to see how the women will react.

Authority - When it comes to unattractive vs handsome men, women
are an authority and people whose opinion men value.

How you can use this framework: Show your audience how someone
with a valuable opinion reacts to two opposite things.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Farmer’s reaction to Lab-Grown VS Real Food [Comparison]
* Musician’s reaction to AI vs. real music

): +520

Why this works:

Desire - This creator’s audience would love to sell their older
home without spending a ton of money.

Refute Objection - Many people assume these updates are going to
cost a lot of money, but “(Without BREAKING the Bank!)” gets rid
of that objection and makes this video more interesting.

Negativity - This is about selling older homes, not new, fancy
homes. Older homes may be harder to sell, so this targets a
specific group of people with a pain point.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about the best
things they can do to achieve a hard goal without a big excuse
they likely have.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Best Updates to Sell a Dying Business (Without BREAKING the
Bank!)
* Best Changes to Fix a Horrible Diet (Without Wasting Hours
Cooking!)

): +2034

Why this works:

Negativity - A big, negative event like dying increases the
significance of somebody’s last actions and words.

Plus, this is from a Christian channel, so the fact that this is
an atheist’s last words adds to the drama.

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you want to know what
their last words are.

How you can use this framework: Tell your audience about a
contrarian person’s famous last words or actions before something
bad happened.

Examples of this framework in action:

* Famous scientist’s last words before discovering c*vid..
* Jeff Bezos’ last words before selling Amazon..

Title: This Guy BROKE The YouTube Algorithm - Here’s What You can
Learn From Him

Hook score: -82

Why this flopped: This video is great, but the title focuses on
the wrong thing.

Most of the titles on this channel focus on benefits for the
audience as listicles or personal stories:

* ""How I Made a Faceless YouTube Channel Using AI ($10K/Month
Revenue)""

* ""The Laziest AI Side Hustle to Make Money Online in 2024""

And all of the thumbnails have the creator's face in them.

But this packaging focuses on a guy the audience doesn't
necessarily know.

At first I thought this video was a podcast or testimonial.

Neither of these things are in line with what works on this
channel, so that's probably the biggest reason why this flopped.

But then I watched the video and I realized it's actually about a
tactic that highlights how the YouTube algorithm worked.

So instead of focusing the title on the guy who broke the
algorithm, it probably would've been smarter to focus the title
on the tactic and/or the benefits the viewer would get after
using the tactic.

Here are two examples:

* This Simple Trick Exposed The YouTube Algorithm
* 3 Things Every YouTuber Needs To Know to About The Algorithm In
2025

I've asked some of the best creators on YouTube, “How do you write such
great titles?”

And they've all said the same thing: “I just model what works.”

So this email will show you 5 videos worth modeling to help you write great
titles and save time.

*Why this works: *

Curiosity - This builds curiosity two ways:

   1. It opens a loop and makes you wonder why he sold his Cybertruck.
   2. It’s a bit counterintuitive. Cyber trucks just got released, they’re
   supposed to be cool, and he spent a lot of money on it… why would he sell
   it?

Negativity - Selling a Cybertruck so early after buying it hints at some
drama and something wrong with it.

Time Frame - The short time frame of 50 days adds to the drama here because
it provides tangible proof he only kept this truck for a short time, so
something must have been off.

Timeliness - Cybertrucks are still trending a bit right now, so this topic
gets extra attention.

*How you can use this framework:* Tell your audience why you sold or moved
on from something trending, expensive, desirable, and exciting.

*Examples of this framework in action:*

makes this video more interesting.

Negativity - This is about selling older homes, not new, fancy homes. Older
homes may be harder to sell, so this targets a specific group of people
with a pain point.

*How you can use this framework:* Tell your audience about the best things
they can do to achieve a hard goal without a big excuse they likely have.

*Examples of this framework in action:*

   - Best Updates to Sell a Dying Business (Without BREAKING the Bank!)
   - Best Changes to Fix a Horrible Diet (Without Wasting Hours Cooking!)

*:* +2034

*Why this works:*

Negativity - A big, negative event like dying increases the significance of
somebody’s last actions and words.

Plus, this is from a Christian channel, so the fact that this is an
atheist’s last words adds to the drama.

Curiosity - This opens a loop and makes you want to know what their last
words are.

*How you can use this framework:* Tell your audience about a contrarian
person’s famous last words or actions before something bad happened.

*Examples of this framework in action:*

   - Famous scientist’s last words before discovering c*vid..
   - Jeff Bezos’ last words before selling Amazon..

Flop of the Week

*Title:* This Guy BROKE The YouTube Algorithm - Here’s What You can Learn
From Him

*Hook score:* -82

*Why this flopped: *This video is great, but the title focuses on the wrong
thing.

Most of the titles on this channel focus on benefits for the audience as
listicles or personal stories:

   - ""How I Made a Faceless YouTube Channel Using AI ($10K/Month Revenue)""
   - ""The Laziest AI Side Hustle to Make Money Online in 2024""

And all of the thumbnails have the creator's face in them.

But this packaging focuses on a guy the audience doesn't necessarily know.

At first I thought this video was a podcast or testimonial.

Neither of these things are in line with what works on this channel, so
that's probably the biggest reason why this flopped.

But then I watched the video and I realized it's actually about a tactic
that highlights how the YouTube algorithm worked.

So instead of focusing the title on the guy who broke the algorithm, it
probably would've been smarter to focus the title on the tactic and/or the
benefits the viewer would get after using the tactic.

Here are two examples:

   - This Simple Trick Exposed The YouTube Algorithm
   - 3 Things Every YouTuber Needs To Know to About The Algorithm In 2025

Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed this week's edition.

9/3/2024 12:18:27,The easiest way to write better YouTube titles,"A few years ago I landed my dream job as the marketing manager at
a fishing company.

Part of my job was managing our YouTube channel, but there was
one problem: it was my first time running a You","A few years ago I landed my dream job as the marketing manager at
a fishing company.

Part of my job was managing our YouTube channel, but there was
one problem: it was my first time running a YouTube channel and I
was terrible at writing titles.

I almost got fired because I was so bad and, on YouTube, a
video’s title is so important.

But then I learned the secret: you don’t need to be good at
writing titles, you just need to model successful YouTube videos.

Here’s how it works: I would find a video that did well in
another industry, like finance.

Let’s say the title was, “10 Best Credit Cards in 2024.” I would
model that idea for our fishing channel and make a video about
“10 Best Trout Lures in 2024.”

It worked so well that not only did I save my job, but our
channel started taking off.

After a few years of this working for our fishing channel, I had
a hunch it would work for other channels, so I started Creator
Hooks.

As it turns out, it does work!

​

​
I'm sharing my story and these screenshots to encourage you that
you can get better at coming up with video ideas, write great
titles, and grow your channel.

I hope you enjoy the Creator Hooks newsletter and I'm thankful
you're here.

## Outreach Philosophy

Here's what we do differently:

1. Actually look at who we're messaging
2. Find something specific and relevant to them
3. Look to learn their situation - to know how best to help
4. Follow up like a human, not a robot

We've scaled offers to $25k+ targeting CEOs/founders using this approach

Not because we had magic scripts.

Because we maintained a frame most people forget:

You're there to understand and help them where they're at.

If our client's service is the best fit? Great, let's explore.

If not? We STILL look to provide value/intros relevant to them

## Rebuilding Broken Outreach

The problem?
- Copy-paste templates everyone could smell
- No systematic follow-ups
- Zero social proof on her profile

Everyone's numb to the same pitches they've seen 47 times this week.

So we rebuilt the entire approach:

We made it conversational. Actually looked at each prospect's situation. Asked questions. Listened.

We maintained one frame: we're here to genuinely help.

Whether that meant our client's services, free resources, or connecting them with someone valuable in our network.

## Content System (AI + Taste)

Not if you do it right.

Here's my system:

Step 1: Extract the client's real voice from 90+ min filmed interviews

Step 2: Generate 30 hooks per topic modelled on winning YouTube titles

Step 3: Kill anything that doesn't pass the gut check (taste)

Step 4: Build bodies using proven LinkedIn post formats

Step 5: Edit ruthlessly for voice against the original interviews

The key insight:

AI magnifies what's already winning.
But it can't build taste.

Taste is knowing which 3 out of 30 hooks would actually stop YOUR audience mid-scroll.

That's built over time. Through reps. Through studying what resonates and what falls flat.

Volume without taste = generic noise
Taste without volume = slow and exhausting

## Founder Leverage & Delegation

Then my body gave out. Eczema. Gut issues. Fatigue.

And you know what? The work still wasn't getting done properly.

Here's what I learned:
Automated tasks are the ultimate leverage
Failing that if you can pay someone 4x less than your hourly rate to do something, you should.

Not because you're lazy.

Because your job as a founder is strategy, not execution.

Every hour you spend writing posts is an hour not closing deals.

Every hour you spend managing DMs is an hour not improving your offer.

Dan Martell calls it "buying back your time."

The founders winning at content aren't creating it all themselves.

They have systems. Teams. AI where it makes sense.

They approve everything. They create nothing.

## Systems Over Hustle

We were doing everything manually.
Every DM. Every piece of content. Every follow-up.

The moment I brought on a third client, the first one dropped off.

I couldn't keep up. My health tanked. Eczema. Fatigue. The works.

So I pulled the plug. Rebuilt from scratch.

This time with systems. With AI where it made sense. With humans in the loop where it matters.

Now?

20 minutes of content input per week.
Follow-ups scheduled.
Admin automated.

Once someone responds?
A real human takes over.

The extra headspace lets me test messaging angles side by side and make decisions on real data.

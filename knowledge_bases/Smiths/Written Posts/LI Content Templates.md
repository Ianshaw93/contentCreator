\# Winning Templates

Plug and play post templates ready for you to go and create some awesome content from day 1\.

\#\# 1\. Simplify

\#\#\# \*\*Template\*\*

People overcomplicate {thing}

Listen, if you’re a {experience level}:

Avoid:

\- {thing they should avoid}  
\- {thing they should avoid}  
\- {thing they should avoid}  
\- {thing they should avoid}

Instead:

\- {thing they should do}  
\- {thing they should do}  
\- {thing they should do}

Focus on this for the first {time frame}.

Build from there.

\#\# 2\. Generate ideas For Hooks

\#\#\# Template

How you think you should {action} on {social media platform}:

\- {Wrong practice}

\- {Wrong practice}

How you actually {action} on {social media platform}:

\- Educational content around {pain point}  
\- Free resources to solve {pain point}  
\- Consistent value and {proof}

Strong CTA's are good but strong brands are better.

Make people WANT to {action} from you.

{Context}

In fact, since I stopped {action}:

\- {Achievement 1}  
\- {Achievement 2}

{Sassy statement}

And {time frame} later, I’ve never been clearer on my reasons to never {action} again.

{Result}

\#\# 4\. 2023 vs. 2024

\#\#\# Template

Everyone says that {thing} changed their life

But this one thing leveled up mine completely.

→ \[what you did\]

In 2023:

\- {things that you were doing wrong/not working}  
\- {things that you were doing wrong/were not working}  
\- {things that you were doing wrong/were not working}

In 2024:

\- {things that you did right}  
\- {things that you did right}  
\- {things that you did right}

Here’s exactly what I did:

1\. {Step}  
2\. {Step}  
3\. {Step}  
4\. {Step}  
5\. {Step}

People who are winning aren't better than you. They just {what do winners do}.

There's space for all of us to win here, we're early.

\#\# 5\. Your \#1 Niche Tip

\#\#\# Template

My \#1 {your niche} {method} tip: {your tip}

(especially if you’re trying to grow)

{Platform} just hit {Metric}; if you want to reach them:

\- Remember they don’t know you  
\- Remember they're here to be educated  
\- Remember they're here to be entertained

It's a social media platform after all.

If you want to reach them all, you need to:

\- {tip point 1}  
\- {tip point 2}  
\- {tip point 3}  
\- {tip point 4}  
\- {tip point 5}

Bonus: {bonus tip}

CLEAR difference.

They’ll reward you by consuming your content, daily.

\#\# 10\. Mindset Shift

\#\#\# Template

This 1 mindset shift changed everything.

When I started {thing} I focused on:

{things you did wrong}

{things you did wrong}

{things you did wrong}

I burned out, but not because I was working hard..

It was because my goals didn't align with my purpose.

I was chasing {wrong goals}, not {right goals}.

I was chasing {wrong goals}, not {right goals}.

I was chasing {wrong goals}, not {right goals}.

The reason? My {external factor} made me think that was the goal.

"Woah, everyone has that, so I should too"

A slippery slope.

And an endless chase for {unreal result}.

Because no matter how many success stories we read.

There are 10x failure ones underneath.

Remember that next time you want to quit.

Or feel burned out. Rest and reassess.

Flip the narrative → focus on growing you.

(until the focus is you)

\#\# 17\. Unique Failure

\#\#\# \*\*Template:\*\*

99% of my followers don't know this about me...

\[What thing you failed at but you never mentioned online\]

But it wasn't because I couldn't do it:

\- {reason you failed}  
\- {reason you failed}  
\- {reason you failed}

So I failed and/or quit them all.

Then I found {thing you succeeded at} and stuck to it for {time period}.

I liked it, I committed to it and eventually found success

For months, nothing was happening. But I persisted.

Then {thing that happened}. It changed my life.

Stop quitting so soon.

To top it all up, each {deliverable} then has:

\- A {unique element} → {its outcome}  
\- A {unique element} → {its outcome}  
\- A {unique element} → {its outcome}

This is exactly how my {deliverable} is {ideal outcome}.

Be specific enough to show authority, but generic enough to reach more people.

1\. Use a proven viral hook format

↳ {Add a hook related to that topic}

1\. Use a proven writing framework

↳ {simple framework using an abbreviation}

\#\# 30\. System Breakdown

\- \[your output\]

In addition:

\- I’m spending {time} making each post

\- I’m \[another task\]  
\- I \[metric\] {task}

If I was to add {rest of what you do excluding the things you mentioned above} , in all honesty \- I’d have a mental breakdown :)

Repurposing is easy but growth and community isn’t.

I rather have 2 {what success looks like} than 5 poor {what success looks like}.

Yeah, maybe I’m missing out on omni-{medium} growth…

But it’s how I’ve been able to ‘win’ on here.

A sustainable and nurtured strategy.

It’s chess, not checkers.

\#\# 42\. Get the Basics Right

\#\#\# \*\*Template:\*\*

Harsh truth:

\- You can take all the online courses

But if you aren’t:

\- Showing up consistently

\- and repeating…

You won’t get the {success in your niche}.

We get so caught up in learning the HOW, that we forget that we actually need to DO.

You can outperform yourself in 6 months without {conventional thing to do} or finding the next new hack.

Nail down the basics and repeat every day.

That’s how you do the how.

\#\#\# \*\*Template:\*\*

My best piece of advice when creating \[thing\]?

Ask yourself: “How can I best help/serve my {your niche audience}?”

👉 \[process of creation\] with one specific person in mind.

\#\# 52\. \#1 reason people fail

\- ⁠ ⁠{usual wanna-be tasks}  
\- ⁠ ⁠{usual wanna-be tasks}

2.⁠ ⁠{action-items that work}

3.⁠ ⁠{action-items that work}

4.⁠ ⁠{action-items that work}

5.⁠ ⁠{action-items that work}

Stop trying to {not useful outcome} before you {useful outcome}.

Start {not useful outcome} while you're {useful outcome}.

Repetitive {something that works} is/are how you get ahead of 99% of people.

Why
 
this
 
works:
 
Your
 
ideal
 
client
 
wants
 
to
 
follow
 
someone
 
who
 
can
 
help
 
them
 
get
 
to
 
a
 
greater
 
version
 
of
 
themselves.
 
Make
 
them
 
aware
 
of
 
the
 
philosophies
 
you
 
abide
 
by
 
that
 
have
 
helped
 
you
 
get
 
to
 
where
 
you’re
 
at
 
now,
 
and
 
accomplish
 
the
 
things
 
you’ve
 
been
 
able
 
to
 
accomplish.

(The
 
more

this

your

be
 
applied?
 
If
 
you’re
 
not
 
growing
 
it
 
or
 
enjoying
 
it
 
-
 
look
 
for
 
something
 
else
 
This
 
has
 
pushed
 
me
 
out
 
of
 
several
 
jobs.
 
It
 
took
 
me
 
a
 
long
 
time
 
to
 
find
 
entrepreneurship.
 
But
 
thankful
 
I
 
left
 
when
 
the
 
learnings
 
dried
 
up.

No

can

Having
 
the
 
skill
 
to
 
make
 
money
 
is
 
worth
 
more
 
than
 
any
 
amount
 
of
 
money.

Ownership
 
over
 
victimhood
 
Don’t

you
 
act
 
the
 
victim.
 
I
 
remember
 
playing
 
footbal
 
for
 
the
 
high
 
school
 
and
 
a
 
goal
 
was
 
scored
 
and
 
they
 
were
 
being
 
marked
 
by
 
the
 
full
 
back
 
but
 
I
 
was
 
playing
 
centre
 
back.
 
I
 
would
 
always
 
take
 
the
 
blame.
 
I
 
put
 
myself
 
in
 
a
 
position
 
to
 
learn
 
from
 
it.
 
Within

You’re
 
not
 
going

any
 
issues
 
without
 
taking
 
ownership.
 
Then
 
making
 
concrete
 
plans
 
to
 
follow
 
through.
 
You
 
can
 
systemize
 
just
 
about
 
anything
 
I’ve
 
been
 
going
 
wild
 
with
 
checklist
 
recently.
 
And
 
am
 
loving
 
it.
 
No
 
airplane
 
start
 
without
 
going
 
through
 
a
 
trusty
 
checklist.

If
 
you
 
know
 
something
 
inside
 
out,
 
your’e
 
still
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
odd
 
error
 
every
 
once
 
in
 
a

And
 
have

client
 
wants
 
to
 
build
 
a
 
relationship
 
with
 
the
 
person
 
they

Your
 
likes
 
and

serve
 
as
 
a
 
window
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
relate
 
to

This
 
will
 
create
 
interest,
 
establish

and
 
solidify

What
 
is
 
something
 
you
 
passionately
 
like
 
or
 
dislike?
 
 
(EX’s:
 
Why
 
do
 
you
 
like
 
or
 
dislike
 
it?
 
“I
 
love
 
gaming.”
 
“I
 
hate
 
travelling.”)
 
Hate
 
having
 
things
 
thrown
 
onto
 
me
 
last
 
minute
 
when
 
it
 
could've
 
been
 
communicated
 
sooner
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
lock
 
in
 
and
 
throw
 
away
 
the
 
key…
 
 
I
 
love
 
new
 
experiences
 
I
 
tested
 
very
 
high
 
for
 
seeking
 
new
 
experiences.
 
My
 
brain
 
gets
 
bored
 
with
 
same
 
situations…
 
unless
 
I
 
am
 
improving
 
at
 
something.
 
I
 
hate
 
someone
 
interrupting
 
another
 
person’s
 
learning.
 
Like
 
someone
 
laughing
 
in
 
someone’s
 
face
 
when
 
it’s
 
their
 
first
 
time
 
doing
 
karaoke
 
&
 
the
 
person
 
is
 
fighting
 
anxiety
 
to
 
do
 
it.
 
Or
 
an
 
adult
 
unwittingly
 
stunting
 
a
 
child’s
 
growth
 
by
 
holding
 
their
 
kid
 
up
 
rather
 
than
 
letting
 
them
 
fall
 
and
 
catching
 
them
 
(stabilizer
 
vs
 
safety
 
net).
 
A
 
learner
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
allowed
 
to
 
fail
 
and
 
learn
 
from
 
failure.
 
 
People
 
look
 
down
 
on
 
beginners,
 
forgetting
 
they
 
were
 
at
 
that
 
stage
 
once.
 
I
 
love
 
having
 
a
 
system
 
Without
 
a
 
system
 
I
 
follow
 
shiny
 
objects
 
every
 
5
 
mins
 
and
 
burn
 
a
 
whole
 
lot
 
of
 
energy
 
without
 
much
 
to
 
show
 
for
 
it.
 
I
 
hate:
 
someone
 
using
 
‘it’s
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
hard’
 
as
 
an
 
excuse
 
not
 
to
 
start
 
a
 
biz/do
 
something
 
they
 
would
 
love
 
Worst
 
case
 
you
 
grow
 
from
 
failure.
 
 
I
 
see
 
too
 
many
 
people
 
in
 
a
 
prison
 
of
 
their
 
own
 
comfort
 
zone.
 
I
 
love
 
growth
 
&
 
learning
 
No
 
one
 
can
 
take
 
skills
 
and
 
experiences
 
away
 
from
 
you.

used
 
to

naked
 
&
 
afraid
 
on

Recently
 
I’ve
 
been
 
watching
 
Will
 
Survives
 
on
 
yt..
 
An
 
american
 
dude
 
builds
 
his
 
own
 
house
 
and
 
survives
 
in
 
the
 
snow.
 
 
I
 
worked
 
on
 
a
 
banana
 
farm
 
in
 
Australia
 
for
 
4
 
months.
 
 
Bagging:I
 
worked
 
as
 
a
 
bagger
 
on
 
a
 
crane
 
on
 
tractor
 
wheel
 
(cherry
 
picker).
 
We
 
would
 
take
 
off
 
some
 
bananas
 
to
 
‘prune’
 
and
 
I’d
 
store
 
them
 
and
 
then
 
launch
 
them
 
over
 
the
 
top
 
of
 
the
 
banana
 
trees
 
and
 
hit
 
another
 
bagger
 
in
 
the
 
head
 
a
 
couple
 
rows
 
away.
 
They’d
 
be
 
jumping
 
around
 
like
 
whatdafuq
 
was
 
that.
 
Humping:
 
humping
 
at
 
least
 
in
 
the
 
UK
 
means
 
to
 
fuck
 
ha…
 
the
 
job
 
title
 
was
 
banana
 
humper
 
lol…
 
but
 
it
 
was
 
carrying
 
the
 
fruit
 
on
 
the
 
shoulder.
 
The
 
cutter
 
would
 
have
 
a
 
machete.
 
Some
 
of
 
the
 
fruit
 
would
 
weigh
 
up
 
to
 
90kg
 
(~190/200lbs).
 
I’d
 
have
 
to
 
catch
 
it
 
on
 
my
 
shoulder
 
and
 
sprint
 
just
 
as
 
it
 
was
 
cut.
 
Otherwise
 
I’d
 
have
 
the
 
tree
 
+
 
the
 
fruit
 
on
 
top
 
of
 
me.
 
I
 
don’t
 
like
 
ketchup.
 
Brown
 
sauce

I
 
was
 
Scottish
 
school
 
champ
 
in
 
volleyball…
 
at
 
the
 
banana
 
farm
 
in
 
Oz
 
I
 
was
 
the
 
only
 
backpacker
 
who
 
was
 
up
 
to
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
the
 
Samoans.
 
On
 
the
 
truck
 
ride
 
to
 
the
 
banana
 
paddocks
 
they
 
said
 
to
 
me
 
‘Oh
 
you
 
good
 
man’
 
I
 
thought
 
they
 
meant
 
you’re
 
a
 
nice
 
guy…
 
‘left
 
hand
 
good’...
 
oooh
 
you
 
mean
 
my
 
spike
 
was
 
good
 
at
 
vb?
 
I
 
had
 
2
 
boxing
 
fights
 
in
 
one
 
night
 
in
 
a
 
night
 
club
 
in
 
Cambridge
 
(England).
 
 
My
 
entire
 
squad
 
were
 
2
 
Danish
 
guys
 
(one
 
of
 
which
 
I’d
 
shared
 
a
 
caravan
 
with
 
on
 
the
 
banana
 
farm
 
in
 
Oz).
 
The
 
guy
 
in
 
the
 
final
 
was
 
an
 
irish
 
gypsy
 
traveller
 
with
 
~200
 
people
 
to
 
see
 
him.
 
They
 
were
 
all
 
singing
 
‘there’s
 
only
 
one
 
Tony
 
Price’
 
the
 
whole
 
time.
 
 
It
 
was
 
my
 
first
 
fight
 
and
 
the
 
I
 
used
 
to
 
only
 
think
 
about
 
football.
 
Now
 
I
 
barely
 
catch
 
any
 
highlights
 
never
 
mind
 
a
 
full
 
game.
 
I
 
seem
 
to
 
either
 
be
 
fully
 
in
 
or
 
out.
 
Especially
 
with
 
entrepreneurship
 
being
 
my
 
main
 
priority
 
in
 
general.
 
semi
 
I’d
 
absolutely
 
went
 
through
 
my
 
gas
 
tank.
 
We
 
were
 
in
 
a
 
group
 
of
 
3,
 
so
 
this
 
fighting
 
man
 
was
 
well
 
rested
 
for
 
the
 
final.
 
[got
 
the
 
final
 
on
 
film]
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
I
 
won
 
the
 
first
 
round
 
as
 
I
 
let
 
my
 
backhand
 
go
 
and
 
he
 
was
 
more
 
getting
 
out
 
the
 
road.
 
Second
 
round
 
he
 
hit
 
me
 
to
 
the
 
stomach
 
and
 
it
 
was
 
hug
 
city
 
from
 
there
 
(lol).
 
Made
 
it
 
to
 
the
 
end
 
with
 
the
 
ring
 
girls
 
for
 
the
 
presentation
 
of
 
the
 
belt.
 
Well
 
beaten
 
in
 
the
 
end.
 
Tony
 
Price
 
Snr
 
(his
 
dad)
 
was
 
so
 
drunk
 
at
 
the
 
pub
 
after,
 
the
 
police
 
came
 
and
 
put
 
him
 
into
 
the
 
policevan
 
ha.
 
Oh
 
yeh
 
Tony
 
Price
 
was
 
17yo
 
and
 
I
 
was
 
25
 
yo
 
ha.
 
It
 
was
 
so
 
powerful
 
for
 
me
 
having
 
that
 
fight
 
in
 
my
 
head
 
when
 
shadowboxing/training
 
afterwards.
 
I
 
was
 
working
 
12
 
hour
 
shifts
 
building
 
the
 
sydney
 
metro
 
tunnels
 
for
 
4
 
months.
 
The
 
money
 
was
 
actually
 
crazy
 
£60k/year
 
equivalent.
 
I
 
used
 
the
 
money
 
I
 
saved
 
from
 
Oz
 
to
 
travel
 
NZ
 
and
 
south
 
america.
 
I
 
had
 
to
 
come
 
back
 
for
 
my
 
sister’s
 
wedding
 
after
 
15
 
months
 
away.
 
 
There
 
was
 
a

who
 
ended
 
up
 
being
 
from
 
an
 
adjacent
 
home
 
town
 
to
 
mine
 
on
 
my

on
 
the
 
metro
 
tunnels.
 
I
 
ended
 
up
 
hanging
 
 
 
out
 
and
 
partying
 
with
 
his
 
hometown
 
friends
 
in
 
sydney.
 
I
 
have
 
been
 
struggling
 
with
 
gut
 
issues
 
for
 
sometime.
 
 
 
Have
 
had
 
to
 
severely
 
limit
 
my
 
diet
 
to
 
cooked
 
meat
 
and
 
salt
 
whilst
 
seeing
 
a
 
specialist
 
and
 
hopefully
 
finding
 
out
 
why
 
my
 
body
 
is
 
not
 
accepting
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
foods.
 
 
 
Has
 
been
 
tough
 
running
 
a
 
business
 
with
 
fatigue,
 
cramping
 
etc.
 
 
Just
 
wait
 
till
 
I
 
get
 
rid
 
of
 
these
 
issues.
 
I
 
still
 
put
 
in
 
a

of
 
work
 
despite
 
these

LIFE
 
LESSONS
 
Why
 
this
 
works:
 
Your
 
ideal
 
client
 
wants
 
to
 
follow
 
someone
 
who
 
can
 
help
 
them
 
get
 
to
 
a
 
greater
 
version
 
of
 
themselves.
 
Make
 
them
 
aware
 
of
 
the
 
life
 
lessons
 
that
 
have
 
served
 
you
 
well
 
that
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
pass
 
on
 
to
 
help
 
them
 
in
 
their
 
journey.
 
 
What
 
life
 
lesson
 
served
 
you
 
well
 
in
 
your
 
life?
 
Where/who
 
did
 
you
 
learn
 
it
 
from?
 
Why
 
is
 
this
 
life
 
lesson
 
important
 
for
 
your
 
ideal
 
audience
 
to
 
adopt?
 
How
 
might
 
your
 
ideal
 
audience
 
member
 
apply
 
it
 
in
 
their
 
life
 
to
 
reach
 
their
 
desired
 
future
 
state?
 
Max
 
growth
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
edge/outside
 
of
 
your
 
comfort
 
zone
 
Life
 
can
 
pass
 
you
 
by
 
and
 
instead
 
of
 
riding
 
the
 
wave
 
of
 
compound
 
improvement,
 
you’re
 
in
 
the
 
exact
 
same
 
spot.
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
2
 
choices,
 
default
 
to
 
the
 
harder
 
one.
 
Drinking
 
to
 
excess
 
is
 
not
 
worth
 
it.
 
I
 
used
 
it
 
as
 
a
 
crutch
 
Drinking
 
costs
 
you
 
days
 
of
 
recovery,
 
focus.
 
What
 
is
 
the
 
need
 
to
 
drink
 
hiding?
 
in
 
social
 
situations
 
for
 
years.
 
I
 
woke
 
up
 
on
 
the
 
street
 
in
 
the
 
early
 
morning
 
with
 
my
 
gf
 
worried
 
sick.
 
This
 
was
 
after
 
a
 
tech
 
meetup.
 
I
 
still
 
had
 
my
 
work
 
laptop
 
on
 
my
 
back
 
tf.
 
 
I
 
was
 
sick
 
of
 
not
 
remembering
 
and
 
having
 
anxiety
 
about
 
the
 
night
 
before
 
and
 
the
 
overall
 
loss
 
of
 
control.
 
It
 
can
 
add
 
extra
 
stress
 
to
 
your
 
life
 
rather
 
than
 
let
 
you
 
let
 
off
 
steam.
 
 
 
Focus
 
on
 
fixing
 
that.
 
All
 
about
 
moderation.
 
I’ve
 
made
 
a
 
checklist
 
for
 
work
 
nights
 
out.
 
If
 
there’s
 
not
 
a
 
proper
 
meal
 
for
 
me
 
to
 
eat,
 
I
 
go
 
away
 
and
 
get
 
a
 
burrito.
 
Then
 
limit
 
to
 
5
 
drinks.I
 
got
 
sick
 
of
 
waking
 
up,
 
thinking:
 
is
 
someone
 
worried
 
where
 
I
 
am?
 
Did
 
I
 
do
 
something
 
regrettable?
 
 
Energy
 
is
 
so
 
important.
 
 
My
 
best
 
friend
 
until
 
I
 
was
 
22
 
or
 
so:
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
riff
 
in
 
the
 
friend
 
group
 
and
 
he
 
didn’t
 
want
 
to
 
deal
 
with
 
the
 
conflict
 
so
 
he
 
said
 
he
 
was
 
going
 
to
 
turn
 
his
 
back
 
on
 
me.
 
He
 
said
 
he
 
had
 
to
 
stay
 
with
 
the
 
other
 
guy
 
as
 
he
 
was
 
a
 
colleague
 
of
 
his
 
band
 
mate
 
or
 
whatever.
 
This
 
hit
 
me
 
hard,
 
crying
 
from
 
the
 
abondonment.
 
This
 
situation
 
made
 
me
 
assess
 
the
 
relationship.
 
I
 
realized
 
these
 
guys’
 
chat
 
was
 
always
 
negative.
 
And
 
I’ve
 
been
 
more
 
aware
 
of
 
people’s
 
energy…
 
and
 
how
 
it
 
affects
 
me.
 
You
 
can
 
have
 
your
 
dream
 
life
 
from
 
the
 
outside.
 
It
 
ain’t
 
worth
 
living
 
if
 
your
 
energy
 
is
 
off.
 
If
 
you
 
surround
 
yourself
 
with
 
people
 
who
 
drag
 
you
 
down.
 
Have
 
some
 
sort
 
of
 
audit
 
on
 
the
 
people
 
in
 
your
 
life.
 
Tasks
 
too.
 
If
 
they’re
 
family
 
and
 
they’re
 
a
 
drag,
 
still
 
see
 
them.
 
But
 
check
 
out,
 
don’t
 
get
 
involved.
 
And
 
don’t
 
feel
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
spend
 
every
 
second
 
with
 
them.
 
If
 
it’s
 
friends,
 
get
 
them
 
chucked.

I
 
come
 
from
 
a
 
software
 
development
 
background,
 
so
 
I
 
naturally
 
look
 
for
 
ways
 
to
 
optimize
 
and
 
automate
 
processes.
 
Originally,
 
I
 
was
 
building
 
chatbots
 
for
 
businesses,
 
but
 
when
 
I
 
worked
 
with

refined,
 
and
 
actually
 
works
 
in

professionals
 
on
 
Instagram,
 
I
 
realized
 
they
 
needed
 
a
 
full
 
sales
 
system,
 
not
 
just
 
automation.
 
So
 
I
 
started
 
building
 
sales
 
funnels
 
and
 
content
 
strategies
 
that
 
automated
 
engagement,
 
nurtured
 
leads,
 
and
 
booked
 
sales
 
calls
 
on
 
autopilot.
 
Over
 
time,
 
I
 
refined
 
the
 
process
 
into
 
what’s
 
now
 
a
 
full-loop
 
AI
 
system
 
 
What
 
input
 
do
 
they
 
give
 
for
 
the
 
system
 
to
 
work
 
They
 
don’t
 
want
 
to
 
spend
 
10
 
hours
 
a
 
week
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
system
 
to
 
work.
 
It
 
probably
 
wasn’t
 
clear
 
to
 
them
 
what
 
their
 
involvement
 
would
 
be.
 
at
 
the
 
start,
 
we
 
create
 
a
 
content
 
blueprint
 
based
 
on
 
your
 
offer,
 
your
 
personal
 
stories,
 
trends
 
from
 
Google
 
Trends,
 
and
 
other
 
sources.
 
We
 
also
 
get
 
weekly
 
insights
 
from
 
you—so
 
every
 
week,
 
we
 
check
 
in
 
to
 
gather
 
your
 
opinions,
 
experiences,
 
and
 
industry
 
insights.
 
AI
 
helps
 
us
 
generate
 
the
 
structure,
 
but
 
the
 
content
 
itself
 
is
 
based
 
on
 
your
 
expertise
 
and
 
voice.
 
This
 
only
 
requires
 
45mins
 
or
 
so
 
of
 
your
 
time.
 
Everything
 
that
 
gets
 
posted
 
goes
 
through
 
you
 
for
 
approval
 
first,
 
so
 
nothing
 
goes
 
live
 
unless
 
you’re
 
happy
 
with
 
it
 
How
 
will
 
you
 
understand
 
what
 
things
 
to
 
post
 
and
 
what
 
my
 
offering
 
is?
 
They
 
want
 
to
 
know
 
whether
 
I’d
 
just
 
be
 
guessing
 
what
 
they
 
think
 
etc.
 
We’d
 
be
 
in
 
a
 
weekly
 
conversation
 
where
 
you
 
share
 
your
 
latest
 
insights,
 
tools
 
you’re
 
using,
 
and
 
any
 
new
 
updates
 
in
 
your
 
industry.
 
We’re
 
not
 
just
 
guessing—we
 
extract
 
knowledge
 
directly
 
from
 
you
 
through
 
Loom
 
videos,
 
voice
 
notes,
 
or
 
calls.
 
Then,
 
we
 
turn
 
that
 
into
 
high-value
 
content
 
using
 
proven
 
content
 
structures.
 
We
 
also
 
repurpose
 
your
 
past
 
content
 
and
 
case
 
studies—so
 
it’s
 
always
 
in
 
your
 
voice
 
and
 
reflects
 
your
 
expertise.
 
And
 
of
 
course,
 
you
 
approve
 
everything
 
before
 
it
 
goes
 
live."

MINDSET
 
Why
 
this
 
works:
 
 
Most
 
times
 
it’s
 
not
 
the

prevents
 
your
 
audience
 
from
 
achieving
 
their

their
 
thoughts,

and

that
 
hold
 
them
 
back.
 
Your
 
responsibility
 
is
 
to
 
enlighten,
 
reframe,
 
debunk,
 
and
 
eliminate
 
their

they’re
 
better

you
 
give

Why
 
this
 
works:
 
What
 
niche-specific
 
stories
 
and
 
case
 
studies
 
already
 
exist
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
to
 
explain
 
a
 
concept
 
or
 
provide
 
your
 
perspective
 
on?
 
This
 
highlights
 
you
 
being
 
both
 
a
 
student
 
of
 
your
 
field
 
and
 
a
 
source
 
for
 
its
 
sharing.
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
some
 
of
 
your
 
client’s/student’s,
 
please
 
share
 
those
 
as
 
well.
 
 
What’s
 
a

case
 
study
 
that
 
exists
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
reference?
 
(Provide

What’s
 
your
 
insight,

on
 
this

as
 
it
 
relates
 
to
 
your

would
 
you

about

LIMITING
 
BELIEFS
 
Why
 
this
 
works:
 
What
 
are
 
some
 
limiting
 
beliefs
 
people
 
have
 
that
 
hold
 
them
 
back
 
from
 
success
 
in
 
your
 
industry/niche?
 
This
 
allows
 
us
 
to
 
identify
 
your
 
prospect’s
 
pain
 
points
 
and
 
create
 
content
 
that
 
directly
 
hits
 
them.

What
 
is
 
an
 
example
 
of
 
this
 
limiting
 
belief
 
holding
 
your
 
past
 
self,
 
a
 
student,
 
or
 
someone
 
you
 
know
 
back?
 
 
Some
 
don’t
 
want
 
to
 
be
 
polarizing
 
with
 
their
 
opinions.
 
I
 
guess
 
I’m
 
still
 
finding
 
my
 
feet
 
for
 
opinions
 
that
 
are
 
polarizing.
 
I
 
must
 
access
 
what
 
I
 
feel
 
strongly.
 
They
 
don’t
 
follow
 
up
 
Too
 
polite.
 
I
 
like
 
to
 
inject
 
some
 
humour.
 
Way
 
easier
 
when
 
it’s
 
systemized
 
rather
 
than
 
writing
 
a
 
fresh
 
one
 
each
 
time.
 
You
 
have
 
to
 
know
 
about
 
technical
 
details
 
like
 
‘back
 
propagation’
 
(method
 
to

to
 
use
 
AI…
 
I
 
got
 
an
 
objection
 
from
 
an
 
AI
 
nerd
 
about
 
this…
 
but
 
brought
 
him
 
round
 
after
 
saying
 
about
 
being
 
self
 
taught
 
and
 
the
 
project
 
I
 
built
 
at
 
the
 
AI
 
hackathon
 
 
I’ve
 
seen
 
plenty
 
of
 
people
 
in
 
the
 
AI
 
space
 
think
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
study
 
python
 
for
 
4
 
months,
 
rather
 
than
 
just
 
building
 
what
 
they
 
can
 
and
 
learning
 
just
 
in
 
time.
 
Not
 
just
 
in
 
case.
 
That’s
 
from
 
the
 
old
 
go
 
to
 
uni
 
mode
 
of
 
thinking.
 
They
 
need
 
success
 
fast
 
Play
 
the
 
infinite
 
game.
 
Every
 
loss
 
is
 
a
 
learning
 
experience.
 
I
 
get
 
the
 
sense
 
when
 
I
 
say
 
yeh
 
I
 
was
 
part
 
of
 
a
 
paid
 
AI
 
group
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
years
 
ago
 
but
 
was
 
making
 
a
 
fitness
 
app,
 
then
 
tried
 
chatbots,
 
ended
 
up
 
making
 
funnels
 
for
 
fitness
 
pros.
 
Then
 
the
 
last
 
year,
 
one
 
success
 
scaling
 
to
 
60k,
 
one
 
failure
 
(see
 
final
 
loss).
 
I
 
get
 
the
 
sense
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
people
 
would
 
look
 
at
 
that
 
as
 
failing.
 
Now
 
I’ve
 
found
 
the
 
model
 
I
 
can
 
invest
 
decades
 
into.
 
No
 
matter
 
how
 
algos
 
and
 
AI
 
change,
 
knowing
 
how
 
to
 
write
 
killer
 
organic
 
and
 
have
 
funnels
 
going
 
off
 
it
 
that
 
builds
 
audiences
 
and
 
lands
 
sales
 
calls
 
will
 
be
 
valuable.
 
Investing
 
is
 
a
 
cost
 
Investing
 
in
 
mentors
 
etc
 
gets
 
easier
 
each
 
time.
 
Previously
 
paying
 
$60/month
 
for
 
a
 
paid
 
group
 
was
 
a
 
lot.
 
Last
 
year
 
I
 
paid
 
10k
 
for
 
a
 
year.
 
I
 
feel
 
massive
 
internal
 
friction
 
when
 
I
 
don’t
 
First

50
 
people
 
a
 
day
 
something,
 
write
 
it

a
 
spreadsheet.
 
I
 
felt
 
way
 
more
 
confident
 
with
 
a
 
well
 
oiled
 
system
 
that
 
I
 
would
 
tailor
 
to
 
my
 
niche/icp.
 
Not
 
going
 
all
 
in
 
I
 
have
 
someone
 
in
 
my
 
network,
 
who
 
jumped
 
between
 
like
 
5
 
HT
 
courses
 
and
 
didn’t
 
get
 
results.
 
I’m
 
happy
 
that
 
my
 
boy
 
is
 
finally
 
getting
 
a
 
paid
 
client.
 
But
 
clear
 
evidence
 
that
 
not
 
enough
 
was
 
being
 
done
 
previously.
 
They’d
 
tell
 
me
 
they
 
wrote
 
5
 
emails
 
that
 
day.

COMMON
 
OBJECTIONS
 
Why
 
this
 
works:
 
What
 
are
 
common
 
objections
 
you
 
get
 
(from
 
potential
 
customers/clients)?
 
This
 
allows
 
us
 
to
 
pre-handle
 
them
 
in
 
content,
 
and
 
ideally,
 
raise
 
your
 
close
 
rate.
 
 
What
 
is
 
a
 
common
 
objection
 
you
 
get
 
on
 
sales
 
calls,
 
DMs,
 
etc.?
 
How
 
did,
 
or
 
would,
 
you
 
handle
 
this
 
objection?
 
 
I’m
 
not
 
sure
 
what
 
you’re
 
providing.
 
Yeh
 
no
 
problem
 
here’s
 
a
 
case
 
study
 
on
 
us
 
scaling
 
this
 
client
 
to
 
$60k/month
 
through
 
end
 
to
 
end
 
systems.
 
With
 
each
 
client
 
it
 
is
 
somewhat
 
different.
 
Let’s
 
sit
 
down
 
so
 
we
 
can
 
learn
 
more
 
about
 
your
 
biz
 
and
 
how
 
we
 
can
 
help
 
you
 
scale

How
 
does
 
your
 
system
 
help
 
me
 
sell
 
my
 
services?
 
We
 
put
 
you
 
in
 
a
 
position
 
where
 
you
 
have
 
predictable
 
sales,
 
so
 
you’re
 
not
 
constantly
 
chasing
 
new
 
clients.
 
You
 
have
 
time
 
freedom
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
closing
 
deals
 
instead
 
of
 
generating
 
leads.
 
And
 
your

growth

How
 
do
 
you
 
improve
 
results
 
over
 
time?
 
as
 
time
 
goes,
 
we're
 
able
 
to
 
get
 
even
 
more
 
likes,
 
even
 
more
 
viewers,
 
even
 
more
 
engagement
 
on
 
your
 
posts
 
because
 
we
 
feedback
 
all
 
the
 
information
 
that
 
we're
 
getting
 
from
 
the

that
 
we're
 
posting—what's
 
working
 
well,
 
what's
 
not
 
working
 
well.
 
As
 
time
 
goes
 
by,
 
you're
 
able
 
to
 
get
 
more
 
engagement,
 
and
 
ultimately
 
this
 
converts
 
into

Answer?
 
 
How
 
does
 
your
 
system
 
help
 
me
 
sell
 
my
 
services?
 
We
 
put
 
you
 
in
 
a
 
position
 
where
 
you
 
have
 
predictable
 
sales,
 
so
 
you’re
 
not
 
constantly
 
chasing
 
new
 
clients.
 
You
 
have
 
time
 
freedom
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
closing
 
deals
 
instead
 
of
 
generating
 
leads.
 
And
 
your
 
brand
 
growth
 
runs
 
on
 
autopilot
 
because
 
of
 
our
 
content
 
and
 
outreach
 
systems.
 
What
 
is
 
your
 
process
 
for
 
onboarding?
 
We
 
kick
 
everything
 
off
 
with
 
a
 
deep
 
dive,
 
one-hour
 
onboarding
 
call.
 
This
 
isn’t
 
just
 
some
 
basic
 
setup
 
-
 
we’re
 
crafting
 
your
 
entire
 
content
 
blueprint,
 
making
 
sure
 
every
 
piece
 
of
 
content
 
resonates
 
with
 
your
 
voice,
 
vision,
 
and
 
ideal
 
client.
 
 
We
 
also
 
build
 
a
 
video
 
sales
 
letter
 
that
 
we’ll
 
add
 
into
 
the
 
DM
 
flow
 
so
 
people
 
get
 
educated
 
before
 
they
 
jump
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
you.
 
And
 
every
 
single
 
week,
 
we’re
 
connecting
 
through
 
Loom
 
videos
 
or
 
voice
 
notes.
 
Why?
 
Because
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
add
 
your
 
personal
 
insights,
 
your
 
stories,
 
your
 
unique
 
perspectives
 
into
 
everything
 
we
 
do.
 
This
 
is
 
what
 
makes
 
the
 
content
 
authentically
 
yours
 
while
 
we
 
handle

the
 
heavy

Do
 
you
 
help
 
with
 
YouTube
 
as
 
well?
 
We
 
have
 
helped
 
clients
 
with
 
YouTube,
 
so
 
we
 
do
 
have
 
that
 
expertise.
 
But
 
for
 
this
 
service,
 
we’re
 
focusing
 
on
 
LinkedIn
 
and
 
X
 
because
 
the
 
feedback
 
loop
 
is
 
much
 
faster
 
than
 
doing
 
long-form
 
YouTube
 
videos.
 
 
But
 
certainly,
 
yeah,
 
we’re
 
happy
 
to
 
help.
 
We
 
can
 
pull
 
insights
 
from
 
our
 
past
 
YouTube
 
clients
 
to
 
guide
 
you
 
in
 
that
 
area
 
as
 
well.

The
 
one

that
 
was
 
a
 
failure:
 
https://x.com/ShawOnTech1/status/18505529

I
 
was
 
doing
 
more
 
growth
 
operating
 
with
 
a
 
skool
 
group
 
with
 
this
 
client.
 
Every
 
video
 
post
 
couldn’t
 
have
 
any
 
absolute
 
language
 
in
 
it.
 
Everything
 
was
 
heavily
 
scrutinized.
 
We
 
were
 
still
 
figuring
 
out
 
the
 
model
 
for
 
the
 
free
 
group
 
to
 
paid.
 
The
 
client
 
changed
 
their
 
mind
 
from
 
a
 
HT
 
offer
 
to
 
LT
 
community.
 
 
It
 
was
 
likely
 
never

their
 
size
 
of

without
 
a
 
tonne
 
of
 
ads.
 
We
 
got

working.
 
I
 
was

the
 
ads
 
actually.

There
 
wasn’t
 
much
 
engagement
 
in
 
the
 
group.
 
The
 
new
 
members
 
didn’t
 
attend
 
the
 
weekly
 
calls
 
that
 
were
 
9pm
 
Dubai
 
time.
 
The
 
assistant
 
of
 
the
 
client
 
would
 
have
 
zero
 
filter,
 
I’d
 
wake
 
up
 
in
 
the
 
morning
 
with
 
8
 
msgs
 
from
 
her
 
on
 
whatsapp
 
all
 
deleted.
 
We
 
had
 
to
 
support
 
every
 
decision
 
made.
 
It
 
was
 
a
 
nightmare.
 
It
 
all
 
came
 
apart
 
when
 
we
 
got
 
the
 
client
 
to
 
make
 
scripted
 
shortform.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
had
 
david
 
goggins
 
in
 
the
 
video
 
with
 
his
 
nip
 
showing
 
through
 
a
 
sleeveless
 
top.
 
They
 
said
 
that
 
won’t
 
fly
 
in
 
UAE
 
with
 
nudity
 
[image
 
below]
 
.
 
Why Goggins like willpower is not the a…
So
 
I
 
said
 
I’ll
 
take
 
it
 
down
 
until
 
further
 
discussions
 
with
 
you.
 
They
 
said
 
we
 
were
 
the
 
experts
 
though
 
lol.
 
So
 
nothing
 
of
 
a
 
paid
 
group
 
was
 
launched.
 
Looking
 
back
 
should’ve
 
cut
 
our
 
losses.
 
My
 
biz
 
partner
 
was
 
in
 
debt
 
and
 
needed
 
the
 
money.
 
I
 
felt
 
obliged
 
to
 
stay
 
loyal.
 
But
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
leave.
 
Many
 
lessons
 
were
 
learnt.
 
 
Previous
 
client
 
who
 
has
 
a
 
$15k
 
high
 
ticket
 
offer
 
referred
 
me
 
several
 
times
 
to
 
others;
 
and
 
said
 
we
 
were
 
a
 
massive
 
reason
 
why
 
he
 
scaled
 
to
 
$70k+
 
in
 
his
 
business.
 
 
Everytime
 
I
 
got
 
a
 
second
 
client
 
my
 
capacity
 
redlined.
 
And
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
clients
 
left.
 
I
 
was
 
listening
 
to
 
people
 
telling
 
me
 
-
 
bring
 
someone
 
in
 
when
 
you
 
have
 
3
 
or
 
5
 
clients.
 
They
 
were
 
going
 
off
 
businesses
 
that
 
only
 
did
 
ghostwriting
 
or
 
only
 
did
 
DMs.
 
We
 
do
 
both.
 
 
This
 
lesson
 
made
 
me
 
bring
 
in
 
a
 
team
 
when
 
only
 
having
 
one
 
active
 
client.
 
And
 
building
 
slowly.
 
 
Not
 
having
 
bulletproof
 
terms
 
of
 
engagement
 
for
 
clients.
 
Such
 
as
 
communicating
 
in
 
slack
 
and
 
agreeing
 
before
 
they
 
jump
 
into
 
conversations
 
with
 
prospects.
 
 
 
Have
 
had
 
2
 
clients
 
jump
 
into
 
conversations.
 
And
 
the
 
second
 
it
 
was
 
multiple
 
times
 
after
 
warning.
 

This
 
was
 
solved
 
through
 
showing
 
our
 
expertise
 
how
 
the
 
conversations
 
would
 
have
 
gone
 
and
 
certain
 
things
 
that
 
they
 
can’t
 
see
 
are
 
going
 
on
 
in
 
the
 
conversation.

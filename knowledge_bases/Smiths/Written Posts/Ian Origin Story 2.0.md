00:00 My origin story. Any memories or recollections that shape who I was. I'd say generally happy.  
00:14 Uhm, I was always curious as a kid. I remember asking a lot of questions to adults. And I Yes, that's what.  
00:24 Led me to, to like, follow my curiosity and leave the rat race. That we'll sort of talk about how, yeah, there was no one in my family who was entrepreneurial around.  
00:34 And, uhm, yeah, I saw the best path. Yeah, I'd be playing sports all the time, whether it was football.  
00:48 Played that by myself. I remember, like, breaking down and kicking it with my other foot. Sort of thing. And, yeah, a smash. Totally smashed our garden fence and stuff like that.  
01:01 Just smashing the ball off the wall. Played for sports teams and stuff. Thank you. Yeah, I've written down here, uhm, my mum would jump at the slightest thing, and I almost had this fun game where I'd be upstairs, like, on the computer, on the dial-up, and, or maybe it was early broadband, and she'd   
01:30 jump, but I'd come downstairs, and, like, we had, like, a Sky Plus box where you could rewind. And, yeah, I'd go and see what she'd jumped at, and it turned out it was, like, a car door closing, or something crazy like that.  
01:49 Yeah, so, I think that's why I have always had, like, anxiety that I had to fight through in high-pressure situations, just If your mum's like that, obviously, you're in the womb, and you're gonna get the stress, eh, hormone cortisol, quite a lot, and then also, yeah, we, we were, I'd, I was closer to  
02:12 my mum, I'd say, ehm, than my dad. My dad was working quite long hours as a lawyer.  
02:24 Yeah, sort of thing. What values, ehm, not sure if this is a value, ehm, but my mum went out of her way not to speak negatively about me, always to say positive things, and that's been a blessing, because, yeah, I've summoned it.  
02:48 Speaks negatively to you, that often turns into trauma, it's gonna restrict your development as a child, probably chasing your curiosity as well, that, that may have been aimed, ehm, but there's a, some comical moments where, yeah, things were so obviously, like, bad, and then she'd be saying, All of  
03:12 us. That's lovely, that's great, I was just like, I realised, like, alright, our opinion's always gonna be bothered, so, I had to take over a pinch of salt, so that included, and I, like, sang for a small amount of time in front of her, and she was like, Oh, that's lovely, that's lovely, and I was like  
03:31 , so out of tune, it was so obviously bad. Yeah. That wasn't all good. Uhm, yeah, I always saw my dad work long hours at his office, come back at, like, seven or something, and then he'd have, like, papers home with him, and, to do, like, court work and stuff.  
04:03 Yeah, so I, I guess that, like, work ethic and whatnot was put into me. Uhm, one story, we were on holiday to a Scotch island near Vastie, and, yeah, we arrived, and there was, like, a small purse on the fireplace mantelpiece, and, yeah, it was probably, like, less than five or something, and, like,   
04:34 it looked like no one owned the money, so I, I just, like, took the coins out of the purse, and then, eh, yeah, I was walking about with it, and, yeah, it must have been for, like, the electricity or something, and, yeah, mum and dad gave me massive, insurmountable trouble for that, and, you know, certainly  
05:02 , lying is a, is a massive thing for me, honestly. Did your childhood positively or negatively affect your journey?  
05:18 Well, like I said, no influence, it was from, like, the business side, so it did take me longer to get into entrepreneurship, let's say, but, yeah, certainly in terms of upbringing and stuff.  
05:37 Definitely positive, yeah, definitely, I feel like I fully developed, there's no trauma there. Not much trauma, eh?  
05:48 In school, ehm, yeah, early time, really enjoyed it.  
06:01 Liked different classes, maths, quite a lot of stuff, I really liked sports, I ended up studying engineering, but that, like, a lot of family stuff.  
06:25 I don't studying engineering, so I didn't even think about it. Uhm, what was your plan to Uhm, yeah, learn in school. I was trying to be a professional footballer until I was, like, 15\. I had a classic injury, one of them guys.  
06:49 I was out for, like, 8 months, and I had signed for a team, or offered to sign for a team in Dundee United.  
07:04 It was quite far away, and I played for them, and they offered me to sign. Yeah. After the injury, I just played for my local team, pretty much.  
07:17 After I left football, actually, yeah, yeah, I didn't think about it. Like, that was my whole identity. And then, I started, like, hanging out with friends on, like, weekdays and stuff, instead of playing football, and weekends as well.  
07:35 And, yeah, I just felt totally lost. I had to find who I really was. So, yeah, I guess I was valuable before I went into adulthood and stuff.  
07:49 Just to be introspective. But, I always enjoyed my own company. To be honest. And then, college. We'd go to university.  
08:05 Yeah, I didn't. So, when I was 18, over the summer holidays, I had a job. That was, like, the job no one would want to have. Uhm, in terms of, like, just having a summer job or, like, around school and stuff.  
08:22 That was door-to-door. Selling broadband. And, yeah, it was the most transformative job I could've had, really. Because it put me in front of a hundred different people every single day. Like a chap in their door. I only got told after I started, like, hitting targets and stuff.  
08:48 But, everyone in the office had, like, totally counted me out. Because of how nervous I was, and I couldn't get any words out. But, I was never not gonna, like, put myself into the fire.  
09:00 And, yeah. Gained Yeah, my confidence was at an all-time high for, like, most of the year, and then it dipped down, but it was still a lot higher than what it was before that.  
09:24 Yeah, I guess that came into play with the football thing.  
09:47 Losing my identity, not knowing who I was. I was in the football area. You know, trying to find the self-worth inside of me.  
10:09 Yeah, so, I felt anxious, and stressed, I guess. What was my dream job, or plan growing up?  
10:34 Yeah, so after, after it wasn't gonna be football, Yeah, I just gonna be something like wind turbines, but there's so much in the field.  
10:50 I did try and get into wind turbines, and ended up learning to code later on. Your college experience?  
11:03 overall, yeah, good student.  
11:19 Did go out, you know, classic three days a week. And, the only time I've properly been pudgy looking was because I was, I was drinking like, it's like three pounds, three layers of cider.  
11:38 In a bottle, and I'd be drinking that, like, two or three nights a week, at one point in the first year.  
11:46 Eh, third year, did that all in Spanish, in Spain. I'll probably touch on that in Uhm.  
12:02 Did you finish your degree yet? Four or five years. Have any side hustles? I spent all my time learning Spanish, eh, certainly during the first two years, and then third year, it was all in Spanish.  
12:20 I took up all my time around uni, as well as working in, you know. across England, and I still know of, like, business hustles as such.  
12:37 I do remember writing on, on Twitter just as, just for lols, after, like, nights out, it'd be like, just, like, getting the club photos, and, like, making jokes about people in the photo, just to, just to get my flatmate to laugh.  
12:56 Uhm, also there was Snapchats, me and my mate would make video Snapchats in the house and stuff, early on, I guess that's the start of content, but, I didn't do content for years.  
13:14 After that, any crazy stories that taught you valuable lessons, ehm, yeah, I guess the third year, all in Spanish turned up, not understanding the accent, ehm, each class had two sides of A4 paper.  
13:38 I four new words to learn before I could even look at the material, sort of thing, and then they had, like, halfway exams, halfway through the semester, so I couldn't speak Spanish, and then I could barely keep up with a class for, especially the fourth, like, four-year set of exams, so I just, like,  
14:01 failed them all, and then I had to reset them at the same time as doing the, like, halfway exams, and, oh, man, it was a nightmare. But, yeah, it was nights where I was taking, like, caffeine pills to try and stay up and study more, and, yeah, it was, it meh.  
14:26 Like, Spain was crazy. Life-changing moments, experiences, like, instances.  
14:42 Had, ehm, couples therapy, sort of thing.  
14:53 My girlfriend has been quite eye-opening, uhm, learning a lot about yourself, uhm, I guess. I'm really thankful about the way that my mum was positive to me.  
15:14 Compared to my girlfriend's mum. Yeah. My girlfriend's got a lot of trauma, and a few, ehm, like, mimicking what her mum does without realising it.  
15:47 that was tough, ehm, having people tell her things that weren't acceptable, and, yeah, it turned out she wasn't listening for a long time, but, yeah, now, now, like, growing together.  
16:01 Definitely. Moving on the right direction. Other life-changing I guess. Yeah, the pandemic.  
16:38 So, during the pandemic, I moved from London to Scotland, back home with my mum and dad. And that gave me space.  
16:51 To really explore things on the side of work. And it started with, like, diving into Bitcoin. I took, it was a course in Spanish, it was like a free course in Spanish, uhm, disruption of the blockchain.  
17:05 And then, after that, uhm, I started to learn to code. So, I wanted to get into a wind turbine job, but I was in a job I didn't enjoy, it was fire engineering, like, safety engineering.  
17:22 I was really repetitive. So, my first project was a Bitcoin price alert. And then, I was in an open source project where we were calculating the wind energy produced by turbines, with changing wind and changing formations of the wind turbines and stuff.  
18:00 But it was like, a sort of OLED way of where I could just, like, explore things and learn, on the side, that I really loved.  
18:11 And it was tough in London because you get home and you had, like, a five person flat and you'd be fighting for the washing machine and everything.  
18:16 And then your bedroom was tiny into, like, I was always, like, learning stuff on the side, so I was, like, doing German, and doing German med classes and stuff.  
18:33 And, yeah, it was tough to find something. But, yeah, uhm, so I was looking to, like, change my career by doing things on the side.  
18:51 And it was only when I got to entrepreneurship that I managed to find something that I was, like, my career was growing me as well as some skills.  
19:00 Or I guess then, so I was learning Python and then I ended up going for, software roles instead of wind turbine roles.  
19:21 I tried to go for both. Yeah, yeah, I actually did apply for wind turbine roles instead. And then I was thinking, oh, will I go for a craftsmasters or will I just go for, uh, junior software roles.  
19:42 I ended up just going for junior software roles instead of paying like £10,000 for one year for a craftsmaster. And yeah, that, the, the growth curve was crazy, and the role was like a different language from what I'd been doing.  
20:15 Uhm, and it was a team of two, so I was doing stuff that my colleague, like, didn't know what to do, didn't know how to do.  
20:27 The senior, uhm, made like a, a 3D universe of emotions, where people could, like, track their emotions, and each part of the map was, like, related to the emotions around it, stuff like Thank you.  
20:46 After that, I found, ehm, it was actually a fire engineering company, that I never wanted to go back to fire engineering, but they wanted someone to do their, like, software, their custom tools, for them, and, yeah.  
21:15 Couldn't have been a better role, honestly, without it being entrepreneurship. Because, I was like, the only developer there, I could, like, figure out how to do the problems, myself.  
21:35 And, yeah, just had to go out and, into the internet, and, like, soak in what other people had done, to be able to, like, then bring that back, and, yeah, produce these tools.  
21:47 I still work for them, two days a week at the moment. But, after a while, uhm, the projects which were so fresh and stuff, I've got to, like, maintain them, instead of, like, always having fresh, new things, and, yeah, that, that was something that made me feel a bit hemmed in.  
22:15 My side projects have changed, from, uhm, from, like, learning a language, to coding, and then I went to a specific Thank you.  
22:28 Projects of coding, so there was, like, a game in there, but after that, there was, uhm, it was an app that I could, sort of, see, having, sort of, some sort of, like, business aspect, and then, it was, like, a fitness leaderboard, that I wanted to use, like, you could, like, log in, all your lifts,   
22:54 how heavy they were, and then, like, it would put you in the leaderboard, and then it would have your personal profile page, with all your stats, and stuff.  
23:02 So, me and my friends were using that. who were, it was, like, entrepreneurs, and they were really into fitness, and that's because no one in my direct network were either of them, and I found that online, and, through that I found a guy who was like really early into AI, so, like, back to databases   
23:45 and stuff, and, yeah, he showed me some stuff, and after that I made a project, ehm, to upskill before I went to a hackathon, so the hackathon was in Northern Ireland, Good to know, man.  
24:04 I came second in that hackathon, the AI15 hackathon, where it was, ehm, it was for, like, a car crash, and after that, the people who were, like, involved would, would ring up, and, yeah, the, eh, the service would, like, transcribe what they said, it would be, like, a voice agent, and it would be, like  
24:40 , Q, QA loop, so it would be, like, it would take the key points of what they said and, like, ask them, is that what you meant? And then after that, that information would be passed down, and have access to older.  
24:52 laws and rules of the road in the UK, it would pull the relevant ones, and it would, it would use all that information to then recommend, uhm, a decision by the lawyer, so all this report would get given to the lawyer.  
25:16 There'd also be, like, using DALI or whatever AI in general, image service, to, like, show, ehm, show images of the crash happening, sort of thing, reproduced from eyewitness accounts, so the lawyer would have all this report.  
25:40 So they'd save a tonne of time, that's, like, expensive, having a lawyer. So, yeah, it was cool meeting new people, coming second. I sort of done that without telling my work, because I didn't want them thinking, oh, no, this is gonna break off, but they were, like, really chill, and happy I'd done it  
26:07 , and stuff. They, like, reposted it on LinkedIn, but the director's a bit of a noob, so he accidentally just wrote a comment, saying, like, aw, look at you, and then, like, as if he was talking to his phone network, when he was just, like, commenting under my post.  
26:22 But, yeah, it was fun. They're all good people, at that, compared to the company. So, after that, we're at a software role, and then, I realise that the app isn't an area and I get into an AIP community and yeah, I'm building.  
26:52 So, I was seeing myself building, like, chatbots for websites and stuff. In that network, it turns out loads of them are fitness professionals, and they've all got Instagram pages.  
27:05 I've not been on my Instagram in absolutely years, at that point. And, yeah, I end up making, like, videos. Many chat flows, and, yeah, I make a service out of that, and I get two really good results from guys, in that network, and, yeah, on the Instagrams, and then I end up, going for quite a high-ticket  
27:45 , paid entrepreneurial community, so that's Charlie Mungan's one, EasyGrow. That previous AI community, like, there was no systems for, like, outreach and stuff, and it was, like, really frustrating, and, yeah.  
28:04 I needed a system to give me some confidence in what I was doing, and something that I could, like, improve and stuff, instead of just, like, ah, send these messages and then, you know, just keep a number and then chase it up.  
28:22 It's like, when do I do it? And then, you know, death. There's a of things that sound like a system that have been tweaked over time, like, Charlie Morgan has that team that are still doing the outreach systems, sort of thing, so it's being updated and stuff, so it was good for that, for sure, and also  
28:49 just being connected to other entrepreneurs. People who are, like, killing it, and, yeah, there was a guy who went to, like, 150k a month and stuff, whilst I've been in that, and I've bounced around some different offers, and Only recently, I've like, found one that, I can see myself, like, staying in  
—-  
00:00 I guess it's important to include the fact that after finding myself in, like, long-term growth services, like Ghostwriting and also Booking sales calls together, I started out using one system that was quite copy-paste, we'd have a VSL, we'd have voice notes, which worked well, just the follow-ups and   
00:38 also each stage of the conversation. was copy-paste, and people could smell that, so we got really good results with our first client using that system.  
00:52 For the second client, we then brought in a second system that was more a full conversation, but we were maintaining the frame that we were, you know, there to help the person, genuinely help someone.  
01:09 and yeah it doesn't matter whether it's the client services that is the best fit if they're best fit great we'll look deeper into that if not also great like we try to help them with free valuable assets like we'd actually look and see what their situation was and all that good stuff and yeah also we'd  
01:45 introduce them to anyone valuable within our client network That was within the DMs, sort of thing. And yeah, there was an issue with that system, which was, The way we were doing it totally manually just took up so much time, so much energy that we couldn't really have more than one client.  
02:15 So we were getting good results, scaled that client to 35k per month, we brought in another client, scaled them to 25k per month.  
02:27 The issue was, we were redlining, and yeah, as soon as we brought in another client, that first one dropped off.  
02:35 All right, yeah, I'm, I'm. Honestly, I was at my breaking point, and yeah, I've now rebuilt the system from the ground up.  
02:50 Whilst, you know, using AI to make it faster, more repeatable, and allow us to serve, you Yeah, I've got my purpose now.  
04:30 Yeah, I know I'm, I feel distant from my previous, you know, friends, family. Why not, in this aspect, just because they're not entrepreneurial-minded.  
04:51 I know there's, yeah, I've chosen a harder road, rather than the easier way. Definitely there was the software development job I had.  
05:06 Just going full time at that would have been a lot easier, but it's not the life I wanted. Fair enough so far.  
05:23 Yeah, scaling several clients to four calls per week.  
05:36 Hitting a 25k+, for four different clients. Four or five, I guess five  
06:00 Yeah, just, eh, I guess my growth in managing people, I had to do that, the fully manual approach, and building it smart now, where it relies on less people, so we can bring in just skilled people, instead of, you know, The last system I had to bring in people before I was earning enough to bring in   
06:36 pretty skilled people. And it was a nightmare. It was a nightmare. And that was a big reason why it broke me a lot, so I had, like, eczema, I had a bit of fatigue, all that good stuff.  
06:59 Yeah, so just rebuilding, pulling the plug there, proud I guess I almost got pulled away to doing something else. after the manual issue, but, you know, I just felt inside me that I wanted to get this another, like, go forward with this.  
07:33 It's just an exciting endeavor, I guess, for me. It brings together a lot of my interests and strengths, whether it's systems building, you know, the programming, coding, AI.  
08:00 And then, yeah, making content for people, I guess. Because I could only make choices on the information I had.  
08:44 But yeah, I had to, I had to listen to my body.  
08:55 The last way wasn't going to work, just, it was costing me too much, energy-wise. and health, health comes before everything, so yes.  
09:20 I guess the, what's my unique selling point, it's what I bring, it's the different facets that I have, so the AI hackathon and the programming background, together with the, like, diving deep into human psychology.  
09:51 Pretty systems. If everything's going for me, certainly in terms of the system building, and whatnot, the beautiful thing about these systems is that you can have a person pass over everything.  
10:26 I guess, my transparency with the journey, the fact that I'm open, yeah, I guess using in the previous method, you would see.  
10:40 I wouldn't say that was a failure, but I've learned from it. Relatability will make sure. Relatable. Transparency again. You know, I'm someone who's getting married in April this year, April 26th.  
11:16 looking to build a great life for it. Future family. I was testing myself, and, yep. Bringing, looking to genuinely bring value to other people's businesses, and like, help them have a good life.  
11:35 I've not been putting out content for a while, so I don't think enough people know about my life right now.  
12:21 I'm not that type of guy.

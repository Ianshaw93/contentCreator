When I was 18, I took a summer job no one wanted:  
(and it changed my life)

Door-to-door broadband sales.

I only found out later that everyone in the office had counted me out. My anxiety was so visible I could barely speak during training.

But I wasn't going to quit before trying.

That summer transformed me completely.

At the start:  
• I was terrified of rejection  
• I couldn't handle objections  
• I froze when put on the spot

At the end:  
• I knocked on 100+ doors daily without hesitation  
• I handled objections with practiced ease  
• I thought on my feet under pressure

The result? I went from the least likely to succeed to consistently hitting targets.

My confidence reached an all-time high and never dropped back to previous levels.

This experience taught me more about sales psychology, resilience, and communication than any course ever could.

People who are winning aren't necessarily naturally confident. They've just faced rejection enough times that it no longer controls them.

There's space for all of us to grow beyond our comfort zones. We're early.

I hate when someone uses "it's going to be hard" as an excuse.

Worst case, you grow from failure.

I see too many people in a prison of their own comfort zone.

When I started out:

• I had zero entrepreneurial influence growing up  
• My entire family was on the traditional career path  
• I was working a job I had outgrown with no clear way out

But "hard" isn't a reason not to try.

It's the reason it's worth doing.

The people who tell you entrepreneurship is too difficult are

often the ones who never tried

or who quit after their first obstacle.

What they're really saying is:  
• "I'm afraid of failure"  
• "I prefer the comfort to the pain of growth"  
• "I want certainty more than I want possibility"

Your dream life is on the other side of "hard."

And once you push through, you realize something:

• The discomfort of growth is temporary.  
• The pain of regret is permanent.

Building a business is absolutely challenging

that's precisely why it transforms you in ways a comfortable job never will.

Don't use difficulty as your excuse.

Use it as your filter for what's truly worth pursuing.

What people think about AI in coaching:

• It will replace human coaches entirely  
• It can only provide generic, templated advice  
• Only tech experts can leverage it effectively

What it actually is:

• An amplifier for human coaches, not a replacement  
• A way to scale personalization beyond what's manually possible  
• Accessible to anyone willing to learn the fundamentals

AI coaching tools won't replace you if you:

1\. Use AI to handle repetitive tasks and data analysis  
2\. Train AI systems with your expertise, not generic knowledge  
3\. Create hybrid approaches that combine technology with human touch

The coaches being replaced aren't losing to AI—they're losing to coaches who use AI effectively.

Consumer trust in online coaching has never been lower. This is where building a personal brand alongside strategic AI implementation acts as dynamite.

The median ROI for coaching is 7x. Imagine what happens when you add AI efficiency to that equation.

Don't fear the tool. Master it.

What people think digital nomad life is:

• 4-hour workweeks  
• Passive income streams  
• Freedom from all stress

What it actually is:

• Hunting for reliable WiFi  
• Building systems that work while you sleep  
• Constantly balancing client deliverables with location changes

I spent 15 months traveling Australia, New Zealand, and South America.

Reality check:

I worked 12-hour shifts building Sydney metro tunnels (4 months) & on a banana farm (4.5 months) to fund that freedom.

This was before I explored ways to make money online.

Location independence through an online biz requires:

• Systems that scale without your constant attention  
• Clear boundaries between work and exploration  
• A methodology that delivers results regardless of timezone

A digital nomad lifestyle won't build itself.  
A systemized business will.

Focus on creating something that delivers value consistently before worrying about where you'll deliver it from.

I placed second in an AI hackathon without formal AI training.

Too many people overcomplicate AI skill development:

• "You need a computer science degree"  
• "You must understand AI model training"  
• "Learn the theory before applying anything"

Truth is they only need:

• A clear problem to solve  
• Just-in-time learning (not just-in-case)  
• Persistence through failure

I recently had someone in my DMs challenge me: "How can you be using AI if you don't know what backpropagation is?"

(later found out that was a way to train AI models)

He assumed technical knowledge trumps practical application.

When I mentioned placing second in an AI hackathon and my software development background, his tone completely changed.

Your audience doesn't care about your technical credentials, they care about the results you deliver.

Don't let your overcomplication turn into procrastination.

The best way to learn AI isn't studying for months before building—it's building something useful while learning what you need along the way.

Invest in yourself. Upskill just in time for something, rather than study for years only to realize it's not for you.

How have you upskilled in AI? Tell me in the comments.

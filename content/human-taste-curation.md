## Post Body

The real workflow looks nothing like what most people imagine.

Here's what I actually do:

1. Give AI a topic and context
2. Generate 30 hook options in seconds
3. Read every single one
4. Feel which one would make ME stop scrolling
5. Pick that one. Discard the rest.

That step 4 is everything.

It's not logical. It's not a formula. It's pattern recognition built from:

- Years of reading content that resonated
- Understanding what makes your specific audience tick
- Knowing what sounds like you vs. what sounds like everyone

AI is the factory.
You are the quality control.

And here's what most people get wrong:

They try to automate the taste part too.

- They take the first AI output
- They don't edit for their voice
- They post generic content that sounds like everyone else

The result? A feed full of AI-generated noise that nobody engages with.

The people winning right now aren't writing every word themselves.

But they ARE choosing every word that gets published.

That's the difference.

Your taste is:

- The hooks you choose over the ones you reject
- The words you swap because they don't sound like you
- The posts you kill because they don't feel right

AI will keep getting faster at generating.

But taste? That only comes from:

- Consuming great content intentionally
- Studying what resonates and why
- Building an instinct you can't teach a machine

This is the skill to invest in right now.

Not another AI tool. Not another prompt template.

Your ability to look at 30 options and know which one is the one.

That's not automatable. That's you.

Build your taste. It's the last unfair advantage.

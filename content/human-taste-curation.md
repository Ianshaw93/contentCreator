## Hook Options (Pick the one that hits)

### A.
AI can write 30 hooks in 60 seconds.

But it can't tell you which one will make someone stop scrolling.

### B.
The most underrated skill in 2025 isn't prompting AI.

It's knowing which AI output to throw away.

### C.
Everyone's obsessed with AI replacing jobs.

But no one's talking about the one skill AI will never replace: taste.

### D.
I use AI to draft 30 hooks for every post.

Then I throw away 29 of them.

That's not a waste. That's the job now.

### E.
Hot take: The people who will win with AI aren't the best prompters.

They're the ones with the best taste.

### F.
AI made content creation 10x faster.

It also made bad content 100x more common.

The filter? Human taste.

### G.
Stop trying to remove yourself from the AI loop.

You ARE the loop.

### H.
What people think AI content creation is:

"Write me a LinkedIn post" → Copy → Paste → Post

What it actually is:

Generate 30 options → Apply taste → Pick the one that hits → Edit with your voice

### I.
The gap between good and great content has never been wider.

And it has nothing to do with the tools you use.

### J.
I stopped trying to make AI write like me.

Instead, I made AI generate options so I could curate like me.

## Post Body

The real workflow looks nothing like what most people imagine.

Here's what I actually do:

1. Give AI a topic and context
2. Generate 30 hook options in seconds
3. Read every single one
4. Feel which one would make ME stop scrolling
5. Pick that one. Discard the rest.

That step 4 is everything.

It's not logical. It's not a formula. It's pattern recognition built from:

- Years of reading content that resonated
- Understanding what makes your specific audience tick
- Knowing what sounds like you vs. what sounds like everyone

AI is the factory.
You are the quality control.

And here's what most people get wrong:

They try to automate the taste part too.

- They take the first AI output
- They don't edit for their voice
- They post generic content that sounds like everyone else

The result? A feed full of AI-generated noise that nobody engages with.

The people winning right now aren't writing every word themselves.

But they ARE choosing every word that gets published.

That's the difference.

Your taste is:

- The hooks you choose over the ones you reject
- The words you swap because they don't sound like you
- The posts you kill because they don't feel right

AI will keep getting faster at generating.

But taste? That only comes from:

- Consuming great content intentionally
- Studying what resonates and why
- Building an instinct you can't teach a machine

This is the skill to invest in right now.

Not another AI tool. Not another prompt template.

Your ability to look at 30 options and know which one is the one.

That's not automatable. That's you.

Build your taste. It's the last unfair advantage.

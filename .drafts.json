Read every single one\n4. Feel which one would make ME stop scrolling\n5. Pick that one. Discard the rest.\n\nThat step 4 is everything.\n\nIt's not logical. It's not a formula. It's pattern recognition built from:\n\n- Years of reading content that resonated\n- Understanding what makes your specific audience tick\n- Knowing what sounds like you vs. what sounds like everyone\n\nAI is the factory.\nYou are the quality control.\n\nAnd here's what most people get wrong:\n\nThey try to automate the taste part too.\n\n- They take the first AI output\n- They don't edit for their voice\n- They post generic content that sounds like everyone else\n\nThe result? A feed full of AI-generated noise that nobody engages with.\n\nThe people winning right now aren't writing every word themselves.\n\nBut they ARE choosing every word that gets published.\n\nThat's the difference.\n\nYour taste is:\n\n- The hooks you choose over the ones you reject\n- The words you swap because they don't sound like you\n- The posts you kill because they don't feel right\n\nAI will keep getting faster at generating.\n\nBut taste? That only comes from:\n\n- Consuming great content intentionally\n- Studying what resonates and why\n- Building an instinct you can't teach a machine\n\nThis is the skill to invest in right now.\n\nNot another AI tool. Not another prompt template.\n\nYour ability to look at 30 options and know which one is the one.\n\nThat's not automatable. That's you.\n\nBuild your taste. It's the last unfair advantage.",
